# Expert Report Conventions by Discipline

Research on discipline-specific expert report requirements, methodologies, and Daubert considerations.

## Overview: Common Elements Across Disciplines

All expert reports must comply with **Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2)(B)**, which requires:

1. Complete statement of all opinions and basis/reasons
2. Facts or data considered in forming opinions
3. Exhibits to summarize or support opinions
4. Qualifications and publications (10 years)
5. List of prior testimony (4 years)
6. Compensation statement

The **Daubert standard** (Federal Rule of Evidence 702) governs admissibility across disciplines, requiring:
- Testimony based on sufficient facts or data
- Product of reliable principles and methods
- Reliable application of methods to case facts

### Discipline-Specific Daubert Considerations

**Common grounds for exclusion:**

**Key case law:**
- Courts reject damages based on "speculative" projections lacking reasonable certainty
- Expert must tie methodology to case-specific facts, not generic templates
- Lost profits must have reasonable basis in historical performance or comparable data
