# Writing Research

Empirical studies and research supporting writing guidance.

## Cognitive Fluency

### Processing Fluency Effect
- **Finding:** Easy-to-process statements judged more true, credible, persuasive
- **Mechanism:** Brain uses processing ease as truth heuristic
- **Sources:** Schwarz et al.; Reber & Schwarz (1999)

### The Oppenheimer Effect
- **Finding:** 86% of people use complex vocabulary to appear intelligent; it backfires
- **Mechanism:** Simple language signals clear thinking; complexity signals confusion
- **Source:** Oppenheimer (2006), "Consequences of Erudite Vernacular"

### Illusory Truth Effect
- **Finding:** Repeated statements judged more true (d = 0.39-0.50)
- **Implication:** Use consistent terminology; strategic repetition increases credibility
- **Source:** Dechene et al. meta-analysis (51 studies)

## Sentence and Paragraph Research

### Sentence Length and Comprehension
- **Finding:** Comprehension drops dramatically with length
  - 8 words: ~100%
  - 14 words: ~90%
  - 43+ words: below 10%
- **Source:** American Press Institute

### Given-New Contract
- **Finding:** Information processed better when known → new
- **Mechanism:** Brain attaches new concepts to existing structures
- **Source:** Clark & Haviland (1977)

## Legal Writing Specific

### Lawyers Prefer Plain English
- **Finding:** Even lawyers prefer plain English; recall improved 12%+
- **Additional:** Plain-English contracts rated higher quality, more hireable authors
- **Source:** Martinez et al. (2023), MIT/PNAS study

### Emotional Language in Briefs
- **Finding:** Briefs with minimal emotional language win significantly more
  - Petitioners: 29% increase in win probability
  - Respondents: 100% increase
- **Impact:** Almost triple the effect of oral argument experience
- **Source:** Supreme Court study, 1,677 cases

### Judicial Decision Fatigue
- **Finding:** Favorable parole rulings at ~65% after breaks, near 0% before
- **Implication:** Reduce cognitive load; make favorable ruling the easy choice
- **Source:** Danziger et al. parole study

## Narrative and Persuasion

### Narrative Transportation
- **Finding:** "Transported" readers show reduced counterarguing, more story-consistent beliefs
- **Implication:** Well-crafted facts sections reduce resistance to legal conclusions
- **Source:** Green & Brock (2000)

### Elaboration Likelihood Model
- **Finding:** Two routes to persuasion (central and peripheral)
- **Implication:** Design for central (strong arguments) while ensuring peripheral cues (credibility, format) don't undermine
- **Source:** Petty & Cacioppo

### Chestek Study on Brief Style
- **Finding:** 78.6% of experienced practitioners prefer "story briefs" over pure "logos briefs"
- **Implication:** Narrative increases with experience preference
- **Source:** Chestek, law review empirical study
