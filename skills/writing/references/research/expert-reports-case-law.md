## The Daubert Trilogy

### Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993)

**Holding:** Federal Rule of Evidence 702, not the older *Frye* "general acceptance" test, governs the admissibility of expert testimony in federal court. Trial judges serve as "gatekeepers" who must ensure expert testimony rests on a reliable foundation and is relevant to the issues at hand.

**The Daubert Factors:** The Court identified several non-exclusive factors for assessing reliability:

1. **Testability** - Whether the theory or technique can be (and has been) tested
2. **Peer review and publication** - Whether it has been subjected to peer review and publication
3. **Known error rate** - The known or potential rate of error
4. **Standards and controls** - The existence and maintenance of standards controlling its operation
5. **General acceptance** - Whether the technique has attracted widespread acceptance within the relevant scientific community

**Key Language:**
> "Faced with a proffer of expert scientific testimony under Rule 702, the trial judge, pursuant to Rule 104(a), must make a preliminary assessment of whether the testimony's underlying reasoning or methodology is scientifically valid and properly can be applied to the facts at issue."

**Practical Implications:**
- The inquiry is flexible; these factors are neither exhaustive nor mandatory
- Focus must be on principles and methodology, not on the conclusions they generate
- The gatekeeper role requires active judicial evaluation, not mere rubber-stamping

---

### General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136 (1997)

**Holding:** Abuse of discretion is the appropriate standard for appellate review of trial court decisions to admit or exclude expert testimony.

**The "Analytical Gap" Test:**
> "In some cases a trial court may conclude that there is simply too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered."

**Key Principles:**
- Trial courts have broad discretion in gatekeeping decisions
- Appellate courts may not apply a more stringent standard when exclusion is "outcome determinative"
- Courts may exclude testimony when experts unjustifiably extrapolate from accepted premises to unfounded conclusions
- Nothing in Daubert or the Rules requires courts to admit opinion evidence "connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert"

**Application in Joiner:**
- Animal studies involving infant mice injected with massive PCB doses were too dissimilar to plaintiff's circumstances (adult human with smaller-scale exposure) to support the expert's causation opinion
- The district court properly rejected the experts' reliance on these studies

**Practical Implications:**
- Document the analytical path from data to conclusion
- Explain why the underlying studies or data support the specific opinion offered
- Address dissimilarities between relied-upon studies and the facts at issue

---

### Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 (1999)

**Holding:** The Daubert gatekeeping obligation applies to all expert testimony, not just "scientific" testimony. This includes technical and other specialized knowledge.

**Key Language:**
> "Federal Rule of Evidence 702 does not distinguish between scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge, and therefore, the reliability standard applies to all expert testimony."

**Flexibility of Daubert Factors:**
- The Daubert factors do not constitute a definitive checklist or test
- The gatekeeping inquiry must be tied to the particular facts
- Factors may or may not be pertinent depending on the nature of the issue, the expert's particular expertise, and the subject of testimony
- For experience-based testimony, courts may consider different reliability indicators

**Application in Kumho:**
- Tire failure analyst's visual and tactile inspection methodology was properly excluded
- The question was not whether the methodology was reliable in general, but whether it could reliably determine the cause of the specific tire failure at issue

**Practical Implications:**
- Even experience-based opinions require a reliable methodology
- Explain how experience and training translate into reliable opinions
- Connect the methodology to the specific facts, not just general principles

## The 2023 Rule 702 Amendments

### Effective Date: December 1, 2023

**Amended Text of Rule 702:**
> A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if the proponent demonstrates to the court that it is more likely than not that:
> (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;
> (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
> (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and
> (d) the expert's opinion reflects a reliable application of the principles and methods to the facts of the case.

**Key Changes:**
1. Added "the proponent demonstrates to the court" language
2. Clarified "more likely than not" (preponderance) standard
3. Emphasized court's obligation to make admissibility determinations

**Why the Amendment Was Necessary:**

The Committee Note explains:
> "[M]any courts have held that the critical question of the sufficiency of an expert's basis, and the application of the expert's methodology, are questions of weight and not admissibility." The Committee declares these rulings are "an incorrect application of Rules 702 and 104(a)."

**Practical Implications:**
- Courts must actively evaluate reliability, not defer to juries
- "Shaky" expert testimony should be excluded, not admitted for jury weighing
- Proponents bear the burden of demonstrating admissibility by a preponderance
- Practitioners should cite Rule 702 rather than just "Daubert"

## Recent Exclusion Cases (2020-2025)

### EcoFactor, Inc. v. Google LLC (Fed. Cir. 2025) (en banc)

**Citation:** No. 23-1101 (Fed. Cir. May 21, 2025)

**Holding:** The Federal Circuit vacated a $20 million verdict and ordered a new trial on damages because the district court improperly admitted the plaintiff's damages expert testimony.

**Key Facts:**
- Damages expert relied on "whereas" clauses in prior licenses stating EcoFactor's belief that lump-sum payments were based on a per-unit royalty rate
- The licensees never actually agreed to this royalty rate
- Two licenses explicitly stated the lump-sum amounts were not based on sales and did not reflect a royalty

**The Problem:**
> "A fundamental premise of Mr. Kennedy's testimony—that [licensees] agreed to pay the $X rate—was not based on sufficient facts or data, as required by Rule 702(b). Mr. Kennedy's reliance on the unilateral 'whereas' recital of each license as representing the licensees' agreement to the $X rate was untethered from the licenses and unsupported by the evidence."

**Broader Implications:**
- Virtually any Rule 702 violation by a damages expert will result in a new trial
- District courts must be more stringent in assessing whether sufficient facts and data underlie expert opinions
- Courts should not err on the side of admitting testimony for jury evaluation

---

### In re Onglyza (Saxagliptin) & Kombiglyze Products Liability Litigation, No. 22-6078 (6th Cir. Feb. 13, 2024)

**Holding:** The Sixth Circuit affirmed exclusion of the plaintiffs' general causation expert and subsequent summary judgment for defendants.

**Three Grounds for Exclusion:**

1. **Improper Reliance on Single Study:**
   - Expert relied on a single, un-replicated epidemiological study (SAVOR) to infer causation
   - Failed to adequately explain why all other contrary human studies were disregarded

2. **Unqualified Analysis of Animal Studies:**
   - Expert admitted he lacked qualifications to analyze animal studies
   - Yet relied on animal data in forming his opinions

3. **Cherry-Picking Bradford Hill Factors:**
   - Inconsistently applied Bradford Hill criteria
   - Report claimed certain factors were satisfied; deposition testimony contradicted this
   - Drew unexplained analogies to different medications

**Key Language:**
> "This cherry-picking 'undermines principles of the scientific method and is a quintessential example of applying methodologies (valid or otherwise) in an unreliable fashion.'"

**No Expert Do-Overs:**
- Court refused to allow plaintiffs additional time to find a replacement expert
- Proper remedy for failing to identify a reliable expert is not to impose costs on defendants

---

### Taylor v. Bristol-Myers Squibb Co. (6th Cir. 2024)

**Citation:** 93 F.4th 339 (6th Cir. 2024)

Part of the continuing interpretation of Daubert standards in pharmaceutical litigation, reinforcing the heightened scrutiny of causation experts in MDL proceedings.

---

## Common Grounds for Exclusion

### 1. Lack of Qualifications

**Standard:** The expert must be qualified by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education to offer the specific opinions at issue.

**Common Issues:**
- Expert qualified in one area but opining in another
- General credentials insufficient for specialized opinions
- Lack of relevant practical experience

**Example:** Despite holding an advanced business degree, an expert who was not a licensed financial professional was deemed unqualified to offer opinions on damages calculations in a breach of contract case.

---

### 2. Unreliable Methodology

**The Daubert Factors Apply:**
- Can the methodology be tested?
- Has it been peer-reviewed and published?
- What is the known or potential error rate?
- Are there standards and controls?
- Is it generally accepted?

**Key Principle:**
> "If another expert cannot replicate your expert's analysis, you will not survive a Daubert challenge."

**Red Flags:**
- Methodology created for litigation (not used outside courtroom)
- Failure to account for alternative explanations
- Selective application of methodology to reach desired conclusion

---

### 3. Insufficient Fit (Relevance)

**Standard:** Expert testimony must "fit" the facts of the case and help the trier of fact understand the evidence or determine a fact in issue.

**Common Issues:**
- General principles not connected to specific case facts
- Opinions that don't address disputed issues
- Testimony beyond the expert's disclosed subject matter

**Key Principle:**
> "Expert testimony must be relevant and a good 'fit' for the case in order to be deemed helpful to the trier of fact."

---

### 4. Unreliable Application (Analytical Gap)

**Standard from Joiner:** Courts may exclude testimony when there is "too great an analytical gap between the data and the opinion proffered."

**Common Issues:**
- Cherry-picking favorable data while ignoring contrary evidence
- Unjustified extrapolation from dissimilar studies
- Conclusions not supported by the underlying data
- Skipping key analytical steps

**Key Principle:**
> "Trained experts commonly extrapolate from existing data. But nothing in either Daubert or the Federal Rules of Evidence requires a district court to admit opinion evidence which is connected to existing data only by the ipse dixit of the expert."

---

### 5. Speculative or Unsupported Conclusions

**Standard:** Opinions must be grounded in verifiable information, not conjecture.

**Red Flags:**
- Assumptions lacking evidentiary support
- Reliance on unverified hearsay
- Opinions based on speculation rather than data
- Failure to explain how conclusions follow from methodology

---

## Report-Specific Deficiencies

### Required Elements Under Rule 26(a)(2)(B)

A retained expert's written report must contain:

1. **Complete statement of all opinions** and the basis and reasons for them
2. **Facts or data considered** (not just relied upon) in forming opinions
3. **Exhibits** to summarize or support opinions
4. **Qualifications** including publications from the previous 10 years
5. **List of cases** in which the expert testified in the previous 4 years
6. **Statement of compensation**

### Common Report Deficiencies

**Vague or Conclusory Statements:**
- Stating an opinion without explaining the basis
- Failing to show the reasoning from data to conclusion
- Saying "I will opine on X" without stating the actual opinion

**Insufficient Basis Disclosure:**
- Not identifying all facts and data considered
- Failing to disclose materials reviewed
- Omitting contrary data from the report

**Scope Problems:**
> "If an expert did not provide an opinion in a report created pursuant to Rule 26(a), that expert will not be able to testify about it at trial."

**Qualification Issues:**
- Opinions outside the expert's disclosed expertise
- Lack of connection between qualifications and specific opinions

### Consequences of Deficient Reports

1. **Motion to strike the report** before trial
2. **Exclusion of testimony** at trial
3. **Limitation of testimony** to properly disclosed opinions only
4. **Preclusion of undisclosed opinions** even if expert is otherwise permitted to testify

---

## Rebuttal Expert Standards

### Timing Requirements Under Rule 26(a)(2)(D)

- **Initial Expert Disclosures:** At least 90 days before trial (absent court order)
- **Rebuttal Expert Disclosures:** Within 30 days after the opposing party's disclosure

**Court-Ordered Deadlines:** Scheduling orders typically set specific dates that supersede default deadlines.

### Scope Limitations

**Rebuttal Must Be True Rebuttal:**
> "The evidence must be 'intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject matter identified by another party.'"

**Prohibited Content:**
- New theories or opinions not responsive to opposing expert
- Case-in-chief opinions disguised as rebuttal
- Topics not addressed by the opposing expert

### Burden Allocation Sequence

> "Rule 26 sets out an unambiguous sequence: if the party that bears the burden of proof on an issue decides to file an expert report on that issue, that report must be filed at the initial deadline, and the opposing party then has the right to file at a later date an expert report responding to the initial report."

### Report Requirements for Rebuttal Experts

**Retained Rebuttal Experts:** Must provide full Rule 26(a)(2)(B) reports with:
- Complete statement of rebuttal opinions
- Basis and reasons for rebuttal opinions
- Facts and data considered
- All other required elements

**Non-Retained Experts:** May provide summary disclosure of:
- Subject matter of expected testimony
- Summary of facts and opinions

---

## Supplementation Issues

### The Supplementation Duty Under Rule 26(e)

**Standard:**
> "A party must supplement in a timely manner, and at least by the time pretrial disclosures are due under Rule 26(a)(3), if it learns a prior disclosure is incomplete or inaccurate (Rule 26(e)(1)(A), (e)(2))."

### Proper vs. Improper Supplementation

**Permitted Supplementation:**
- Correcting mathematical errors
- Adding information not available at time of initial report
- Correcting inaccuracies discovered after disclosure

**Prohibited "Supplementation":**
- New theories or methodologies
- Strengthening inadequately prepared opinions
- Materially changing the opinion

**Key Distinction:**
> "Supplementation is not available to strengthen an opinion that was inadequately prepared."

### Rule 37(c) Sanctions

**Automatic Exclusion Rule:**
> "Rule 37(c) provides that the party failing to make timely disclosures 'is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence on a motion, at a hearing, or at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.'"

**No Bad Faith Required:**
> "Courts do not need to make a finding of willfulness or bad faith to exclude the undisclosed evidence."

### Exceptions: Substantial Justification and Harmlessness

**Factors Courts Consider (Second Circuit Patterson Factors):**
1. The party's explanation for the failure to comply
2. The importance of the testimony of the precluded witness
3. The prejudice suffered by the opposing party
4. The possibility of a continuance

**What Usually Fails:**
- Mistake or inadvertence
- Pattern of delay
- Repeated postponement requests

**What May Succeed:**
- Newly discovered facts unavailable at original deadline
- Disclosure so close to original deadline as to be harmless
- Adequate time for opposing party to respond

### Measuring Prejudice

**Proximity to Trial:** The closer to trial the late disclosure, the greater the prejudice.

**Rebuttal Burden:** If late disclosure requires opposing party to find and prepare a rebuttal expert, courts find prejudice.

**Example:** In *Beaudette v. Louisville Ladder, Inc.*, 462 F.3d 22 (1st Cir. 2006), exclusion was affirmed for an expert disclosed five weeks before trial.

## Practical Takeaways for Report Drafting

### Structure and Content

1. **State opinions clearly and completely.** Do not reserve opinions for testimony. If it's not in the report, you likely cannot testify to it.

2. **Explain the basis for each opinion.** Connect the dots between data, methodology, and conclusion. Show your analytical work.

3. **Disclose all materials considered.** Include everything reviewed, even materials not ultimately relied upon. Rule 26 requires disclosure of facts and data "considered," not just "relied upon."

4. **Match opinions to qualifications.** For each opinion, ensure the expert's qualifications support that specific opinion.

5. **Address contrary evidence.** Acknowledge and explain conflicting data. Cherry-picking is fatal.

### Methodology Documentation

6. **Describe methodology in detail.** Explain what you did, why you did it, and how it applies to the specific facts.

7. **Cite authoritative sources.** Reference peer-reviewed literature, industry standards, and established methodologies.

8. **Show testability and acceptance.** If possible, demonstrate that the methodology has been tested, peer-reviewed, and accepted.

9. **Acknowledge limitations.** Note any qualifications, caveats, or limitations on opinions.

### Avoiding Common Pitfalls

10. **Don't extrapolate without explanation.** If relying on studies with different circumstances, explain why the extrapolation is valid.

11. **Maintain consistency.** Ensure deposition testimony matches the report. Unexplained changes undermine reliability.

12. **Stay within scope.** Opinions must stay within (a) the expert's qualifications and (b) the disclosed subject matter.

13. **Apply methodology consistently.** Don't apply criteria selectively to reach a desired outcome.

14. **Ground opinions in case-specific facts.** General principles must be connected to the actual evidence in the case.

### Timing and Supplementation

15. **Meet all deadlines.** Untimely disclosures face automatic exclusion.

16. **Supplement carefully.** Corrections are permitted; new theories are not.

17. **Document the basis for any supplement.** Explain why supplementation is proper under Rule 26(e).
