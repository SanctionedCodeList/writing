## Daubert vs. Frye: Admissibility Standards by State

### Overview of the Standards

**Daubert Standard** (from *Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc.*, 509 U.S. 579 (1993)):
- Trial judge acts as "gatekeeper" for expert testimony
- Requires assessment of whether expert's reasoning and methodology is scientifically valid
- Multi-factor inquiry examining testability, peer review, error rates, and general acceptance
- More flexible, case-by-case reliability assessment

**Frye Standard** (from *Frye v. United States*, 293 F. 1013 (D.C. Cir. 1923)):
- Expert methodology must be "generally accepted" in the relevant scientific community
- Focus solely on acceptance within the scientific community
- Does not evaluate the expert's conclusions, only methodology acceptance
- More rigid, community-consensus-based approach

### States Following Daubert

## State Disclosure Rules Compared to Federal FRCP 26(a)(2)

### Federal Rule Summary

Under FRCP 26(a)(2), parties must disclose:

**For Retained Experts (full written report required):**
- Complete statement of all opinions and basis/reasons
- Facts or data considered in forming opinions
- Exhibits to be used
- Qualifications and publications (past 10 years)
- Prior testimony list (past 4 years)
- Compensation statement

**For Non-Retained Experts:**
- Subject matter of expected testimony
- Summary of facts and opinions

**Timing:** 90 days before trial; rebuttal experts within 30 days of opposing disclosure

### Key State Differences

| Feature | Federal | California | New York | Texas | Florida | Illinois |
|---------|---------|------------|----------|-------|---------|----------|
| Written report required | Yes (retained experts) | No (declaration by counsel) | No | Yes (for retained) | No | No |
| Signed by expert | Yes | No (attorney signs) | No | N/A | No | No |
| Prior testimony list | Yes (4 years) | No | No | Yes (4 years) | Yes | Yes (4 years) |
| Publications list | Yes (10 years) | No | No | Yes (10 years) | No | No |
| Default disclosure trigger | Automatic | Upon demand | Upon request | Automatic (2021+) | Via interrogatories | Via interrogatories |

**Key Observations:**
- Many states do not require formal expert reports as detailed as federal requirements
- California requires attorney-signed declarations rather than expert-signed reports
- New York focuses on comprehensive disclosure without mandating formal reports
- Texas closely mirrors federal requirements after 2021 rule amendments
- Florida and Illinois proceed primarily through interrogatory responses

2. **Simultaneous vs. Sequential Exchange:**
   - California uses simultaneous exchange followed by supplemental period
   - Federal courts often order sequential disclosure (plaintiff first, then defendant)

3. **Supplementation Duties:** All jurisdictions impose ongoing duty to supplement disclosures when information changes or becomes incomplete.

4. **Consequences of Late Disclosure:** Varies by jurisdiction but typically includes:
   - Exclusion of expert testimony (most common sanction)
   - Monetary sanctions
   - Continuance granted to opposing party
   - Factors considered: explanation for delay, importance of testimony, prejudice to opponent, availability of lesser remedy

- Must have devoted majority of professional time in year before incident to active clinical practice or instruction in that specialty

**General Requirements Across States:**
- Affiant must be familiar with applicable standard of care
- Often requires recent or ongoing clinical experience in same specialty
- Must state reasonable basis to believe care fell below professional standard

#### States Without Merit Affidavit Requirements

Approximately **21 states** plus District of Columbia do not have formal statutory requirements for certificates or affidavits of merit.

#### "Common Knowledge" Exception

Many states recognize the "common knowledge" doctrine—when negligence is so apparent that a layperson can understand it without expert testimony (e.g., surgical sponge left in patient), no expert affidavit is required.

### Summary Judgment Affidavit Requirements

Expert affidavits in summary judgment proceedings must generally include:

- Expert's qualifications

- Methodology used
- Material facts relied upon
- Compliance with applicable legal standards (Daubert or Frye factors)

**Key Principles:**
- Affidavits must be "made on personal knowledge" (FRCP 56(c))

- Must demonstrate reliable methodology application
- Evidence need not be in admissible form at summary judgment stage, but must show it could be presented in admissible form at trial

---

## Expert Report Format Requirements

### Federal Standard (Benchmark)

Under FRCP 26(a)(2)(B), retained expert reports must:
- Be **prepared and signed by the expert**
- Contain complete statement of all opinions with basis and reasons
- List facts or data considered
- Include supporting exhibits
- Provide qualifications and publications (10 years)
- List prior testimony (4 years)
- State compensation

### State Variations in Format Requirements

| Jurisdiction | Written Report Required | Expert Signature Required | Key Format Notes |
|--------------|------------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Federal** | Yes (retained experts) | Yes | Full detailed report |
| **Texas** | Yes (retained experts) | No explicit requirement | Mirrors federal requirements |
| **California** | No (declaration only) | No (attorney signs) | Brief narrative summaries |
| **New York** | No | No | Comprehensive disclosure without formal report |

| **Illinois** | No | No | Via interrogatory responses |
| **Pennsylvania** | Summary required | No explicit requirement | Report or summary of substance |
| **Georgia** | No | No | Via interrogatory responses |
| **New Jersey** | Summary required | No explicit requirement | Written report summarizing opinions |
| **Massachusetts** | Upon request | Yes (Rule 30B) | Signed by expert for pre-trial memo |

### Attorney Involvement in Report Preparation

- Attorneys may assist experts in preparing reports
- Final product must accurately reflect witness's credentials and experience
- Courts vary on permissible extent of attorney involvement
- Counsel may not draft entire report without expert input
- Report should be signed by expert to authenticate opinions

### Consequences of Inadequate Reports

- Reports too vague or conclusory may result in exclusion
- Failure to provide basis for conclusions leads to preclusion
- Default sanction under FRCP 37(c)(1): exclusion unless "substantially justified or harmless"
- Additional sanctions may include fee awards or jury instruction regarding failure

## Practice Considerations

### Checklist for Multi-Jurisdictional Practice

When handling expert witness matters across state lines:

1. **Identify Admissibility Standard:** Determine whether Daubert or Frye applies
2. **Check Disclosure Mechanism:** Automatic vs. upon demand vs. via interrogatories
3. **Verify Format Requirements:** Full report, summary, or declaration
4. **Confirm Signature Requirements:** Expert signature vs. attorney signature
5. **Calculate Deadlines:** Based on trial date, discovery close, or other trigger
6. **Review Local Rules:** County or district-specific protocols may apply
7. **Assess Affidavit Requirements:** Especially in medical malpractice cases
8. **Plan for Supplementation:** Understand ongoing disclosure obligations

### Strategic Considerations

- **Frye jurisdictions:** Consider filing Frye motion early to challenge novel methodologies
- **California:** Strict timing tied to trial date; calendar carefully
- **New York:** Limited expert depositions; prepare for motion practice reliance
- **Texas:** 2021 amendments created more federal-like automatic disclosures
- **Medical malpractice:** Verify expert specialty requirements for affidavits
