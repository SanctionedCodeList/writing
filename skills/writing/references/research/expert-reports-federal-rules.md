## FRCP Rule 26(a)(2) - Expert Disclosure Requirements

### Overview

Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26(a)(2) governs the disclosure of expert witnesses in federal civil litigation. The rule establishes mandatory disclosure requirements, specifying who must disclose, what must be disclosed, and when disclosures must occur.

### Rule Text

#### Rule 26(a)(2)(A) - Identity Disclosure

> A party must disclose to the other parties the identity of any witness it may use at trial to present evidence under Federal Rule of Evidence 702, 703, or 705.

#### Rule 26(a)(2)(B) - Written Report Requirements (Retained Experts)

> Unless otherwise stipulated or ordered by the court, this disclosure must be accompanied by a written report--prepared and signed by the witness--if the witness is one retained or specially employed to provide expert testimony in the case or one whose duties as the party's employee regularly involve giving expert testimony.

**The written report must contain:**

1. **A complete statement of all opinions** the witness will express and the basis and reasons for them

2. **The facts or data considered** by the witness in forming the opinions

3. **Any exhibits** that will be used to summarize or support the opinions

4. **The witness's qualifications**, including a list of all publications authored in the previous 10 years

5. **A list of all other cases** in which, during the previous 4 years, the witness testified as an expert at trial or by deposition

6. **A statement of compensation** to be paid for the study and testimony in the case

#### Rule 26(a)(2)(C) - Non-Retained Experts

For experts not required to provide a written report (such as treating physicians), the disclosure must state:

- The subject matter on which the witness is expected to present evidence under FRE 702, 703, or 705
- A summary of the facts and opinions to which the witness is expected to testify

### Key Requirements

**"Complete Statement" Requirement**: The report must contain a complete statement of all opinions, not merely identify topics. Courts have held that it is insufficient for an expert to state they will provide an opinion on an issue; rather, that opinion must be stated in the report along with supporting reasoning.

**Signature Requirement**: The expert must prepare and sign the report personally, acknowledging ownership of the opinions expressed.

**Work Product Protection**: Under Rule 26(b)(4)(B)-(C), communications between attorneys and retained experts are protected work product, except for communications that:
- Relate to compensation
- Identify facts or data provided by counsel that the expert considered
- Identify assumptions provided by counsel that the expert relied upon

## FRE Rule 702 - Expert Testimony Standards (2023 Amendment)

### Current Rule Text (Effective December 1, 2023)

> A witness who is qualified as an expert by knowledge, skill, experience, training, or education may testify in the form of an opinion or otherwise if the proponent demonstrates to the court that it is more likely than not that:
>
> (a) the expert's scientific, technical, or other specialized knowledge will help the trier of fact to understand the evidence or to determine a fact in issue;
>
> (b) the testimony is based on sufficient facts or data;
>
> (c) the testimony is the product of reliable principles and methods; and
>
> (d) the expert's opinion reflects a reliable application of the principles and methods to the facts of the case.

### 2023 Amendment Changes

The December 1, 2023 amendments made two primary clarifications:

**1. Preponderance Standard Clarification**

The amendment clarifies that the proponent of expert testimony bears the burden of establishing all four criteria (a) through (d) by a **preponderance of the evidence**. The proponent must prove that the expert's methods are "more likely than not" reliable.

*Advisory Committee Note*: "Many courts have incorrectly determined" that Rule 702 inquiries are "governed by the more permissive Rule 104(b) standard" rather than Rule 104(a).

**2. Expert Opinions Must Stay Within Bounds**

Rule 702(d) was amended to emphasize that an expert's opinion must stay within the bounds of what can be concluded from a reliable application of the expert's basis and methodology. This addresses the problem of expert "overstatement."

*Advisory Committee Note*: The amendment "is especially pertinent to the testimony of forensic experts in both criminal and civil cases."

### Purpose of the Amendments

The Advisory Committee noted that prior to the amendments, courts frequently:
- Treated reliability requirements as questions of weight rather than admissibility
- Failed to hold proponents to their burden on admissibility
- Invoked Rule 702's language but admitted testimony without proper findings

The amendments clarify that courts must perform a proper Rule 702 analysis before admitting expert opinion over objection. A court cannot simply invoke the Rule's language and admit testimony without finding by a preponderance of the evidence that the testimony meets all requirements.

### Judicial Gatekeeping Role

The judge's gatekeeping duty is continuing. If an expert overstates an opinion at trial, the court must strike the testimony. The Advisory Committee Notes explain that judicial gatekeeping is "essential" to monitoring those bounds.

## The Daubert Standard

### Foundation: Daubert v. Merrell Dow Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 509 U.S. 579 (1993)

The Supreme Court held that the trial judge must act as a "gatekeeper" and make a flexible determination as to whether an expert's testimony is based on scientifically valid reasoning that can be properly applied to the facts at hand.

### The Five Daubert Reliability Factors

The Daubert Court identified five non-exclusive factors for assessing reliability:

1. **Testability**: Whether the expert's technique or theory can be or has been tested

2. **Peer Review and Publication**: Whether the theory or technique has been subjected to peer review and publication

3. **Error Rate**: The known or potential rate of error of the technique or theory when applied

4. **Standards and Controls**: The existence and maintenance of standards and controls governing the technique's operation

5. **General Acceptance**: The degree to which the theory or technique has been generally accepted in the relevant scientific community

**Important**: These factors are not exhaustive or definitive. The standard is flexible, and its applicability may vary depending on the circumstances of each case.

### The Daubert Trilogy

**General Electric Co. v. Joiner, 522 U.S. 136 (1997)**
- Established abuse of discretion as the standard of appellate review for Daubert decisions
- Held that courts may examine the analytical gap between data and expert conclusions

**Kumho Tire Co. v. Carmichael, 526 U.S. 137 (1999)**
- Extended Daubert's gatekeeping obligation to all expert testimony, including non-scientific technical or specialized knowledge
- Rule 702 does not distinguish between "scientific" knowledge and "technical" or "other specialized" knowledge
- Trial courts have discretion in how to assess reliability for different types of expert testimony
- The Daubert factors may or may not be appropriate depending on the expertise involved

### Relevance ("Fit") Requirement

Beyond reliability, expert testimony must "fit" the facts of the case. If an expert computes the wrong measure of recovery or addresses issues not relevant to the dispute, the testimony will be excluded as irrelevant.

## Disclosure Timing and Supplementation

### Initial Disclosure Deadlines - Rule 26(a)(2)(D)

| Type of Expert | Default Deadline |
|----------------|------------------|
| Primary experts | At least 90 days before trial |
| Rebuttal experts | Within 30 days after opposing party's disclosure |

**Note**: Courts frequently adjust these deadlines through case management orders. Attorneys must carefully review scheduling orders for case-specific deadlines.

### Supplementation Requirements - Rule 26(e)

Parties have an ongoing duty to supplement expert disclosures if they discover that prior information was incomplete or incorrect in a material respect.

**Scope of Duty**: The supplementation duty extends to:
- Information contained in the expert report
- Information provided through expert depositions
- Changes in the expert's opinions or the basis for them

**Timing**: Supplementation must occur in a timely manner, and at least by the time pretrial disclosures are due under Rule 26(a)(3).

**Critical Distinction**: Rule 26(e) permits supplementation to fix incomplete or incorrect disclosures. It does not authorize entirely new opinions or analyses that should have been disclosed initially.

### Sanctions for Non-Compliance - Rule 37(c)(1)

> If a party fails to provide information or identify a witness as required by Rule 26(a) or (e), the party is not allowed to use that information or witness to supply evidence...at a trial, unless the failure was substantially justified or is harmless.

**Default Sanction**: Exclusion is the mandatory sanction in the ordinary case.

**Exceptions**: The non-disclosing party may avoid exclusion by showing the failure was:
- Substantially justified, OR
- Harmless

**Factors Courts Consider**:
1. The party's explanation for the failure to comply
2. The importance of the testimony of the precluded witness
3. The prejudice suffered by the opposing party
4. The possibility of a continuance to cure prejudice

**Prejudice Assessment**: Courts often measure prejudice by proximity to trial. The closer to trial the late disclosure occurs, the greater the prejudice.

## Common Deficiencies Leading to Exclusion

### 1. Lack of Qualifications

Experts must have specific qualifications related to each aspect of their opinions.

**Example**: In *Carter v. United States*, an expert was excluded despite being an experienced doctor because he lacked requisite knowledge, training, and experience in the specific emergency room care specialty at issue.

**Example**: An expert was excluded from testifying about whether a shifter assembly contained a design defect because he had no experience or training in shifter or transmission design and had never been employed by an automotive component supplier.

### 2. Unreliable Methodology

**Common Issues**:
- Failure to use generally accepted methods in the field
- Insufficient testing or validation of methods
- Using methods outside their established parameters
- Completely subjective methodology without objective grounding

**Case Example**: In *Farmers Ins. Co. v. DNS Auto Glass Shop LLC* (D. Ariz. Mar. 25, 2024), the court excluded an expert who offered only his "general experience in the industry, coupled with vague references to conversations he's had over years" because the defendants had "not shown by a preponderance of the evidence" that the opinion met Rule 702 requirements.

### 3. Ipse Dixit Opinions (Unsupported Conclusions)

"Ipse dixit" (Latin: "he himself said it") refers to assertions based solely on the expert's authority without supporting evidence.

**Legal Standard**: An expert's simple ipse dixit is insufficient; the expert must explain the basis of the statement to link conclusions to the facts. *Earle v. Ratliff*, 998 S.W.2d 882, 890 (Tex. 1999).

**Case Example**: In *Apex REI Series, LLC v. Great Lakes Insurance SE* (2023), an expert's causation opinion was excluded because it was "connected to existing data only by [her] ipse dixit." The expert asserted conclusions based on general "skills, knowledge, training, and experience" without detailing specific observations supporting her conclusions.

### 4. Opinions Beyond Expert's Area of Expertise

Experts cannot testify about matters outside their established expertise.

**Example**: An accountant whose testimony expands into causation may be excluded entirely. Valuation experts cannot offer opinions or conclusions about legal issues.

### 5. Analytical Gap Between Data and Conclusions

Courts may exclude testimony when there is too great an analytical gap between the data and the expert's conclusions. *General Electric Co. v. Joiner*, 522 U.S. 136 (1997).

### 6. Insufficient Facts or Data

Rule 702(b) requires testimony be based on "sufficient facts or data." Opinions based on:
- Incomplete information
- Unverified assumptions
- Patient self-reports alone (in some contexts)

may be excluded.

### 7. Failure to Account for Alternative Explanations

In causation cases, experts who fail to consider or rule out alternative causes may have their testimony excluded as unreliable.

### 8. Untimely Disclosure

**Case Example**: In the Western District of Texas (Feb. 24, 2022), a plaintiff's expert report was stricken because the initial report used the wrong parties in a hypothetical negotiation analysis, and the "supplemental" report correcting this error was untimely and thus stricken.

### 9. Opinions Exceeding Methodological Bounds (Post-2023)

Under the amended Rule 702(d), expert conclusions cannot exceed what the methodology reliably supports.

**Advisory Committee Guidance**: Forensic experts should:
- Avoid claims of absolute certainty when using subjective methodologies
- Provide error rates where available
- Acknowledge limitations of their methods

## Recent Case Law (2020-2025)

### Cases Applying 2023 Rule 702 Amendments

**Skaggs v. Ferrellgas, Inc.**, 2023 WL 8711898 (S.D. Ind. Dec. 18, 2023)
- Expert report based on "45 plus years of experience within the safety and health profession" challenged under amended Rule 702
- Court applied preponderance standard to assess reliability

**Farmers Ins. Co. v. DNS Auto Glass Shop LLC**, 2024 WL 1256042 (D. Ariz. Mar. 25, 2024)
- Explicitly applied 2023 Rule 702 amendments
- Excluded expert who offered only "general experience in the industry" and "vague references to conversations"
- Held defendants had "not shown by a preponderance of the evidence" that the expert's opinion met Rule 702

**United States v. Diaz**, No. 24-CR-0032 MV, 2024 WL 758395 (D.N.M. Feb. 23, 2024)
- Court relied on Rule 702 amendments to prohibit law enforcement officers from providing expert testimony based solely on industry experience

**McCoy v. DePuy Orthopaedics, Inc.**, No. 22-CV-2075 JLS, 2024 WL 1705952 (S.D. Cal. Apr. 19, 2024)
- Noted that "Rule 702's 2023 amendments do not represent the sea change Defendants contend"
- Suggests amendments clarify rather than dramatically alter existing standards

### Circuit Court Recognition

The **Sixth Circuit** moved swiftly to align its gatekeeping analysis with the 2023 amendment, recognizing within three months that the changes "were drafted to correct some court decisions incorrectly holding 'that the critical questions of the sufficiency of an expert's basis, and the application of the expert's methodology, are questions of weight and not admissibility.'"

### Expert Reports Stricken for Procedural Deficiencies

**Western District of Texas** (Feb. 24, 2022)
- Expert's initial report used wrong parties in hypothetical negotiation analysis
- Court struck report as it could not withstand Daubert challenge
- "Supplemental" report with correct parties was untimely and stricken
