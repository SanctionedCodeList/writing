# Academic Style

Use for law review articles, scholarly publications, and academic legal writing.

## Voice & Tone

### Formal but Accessible

Law review writing is formal—but not stuffy. The goal is precision without obscurity.

**Good:** "This Article argues that traditional agency doctrine cannot accommodate autonomous AI agents."

**Too casual:** "This paper is about how agency law doesn't really work for AI."

**Too stuffy:** "The instant scholarly contribution endeavors to demonstrate the inapplicability of heretofore-established agency jurisprudence to artificially intelligent autonomous systems."

### Person and Perspective

- **Standard:** Third person ("This Article argues..." not "I argue...")
- **Acceptable:** First person for strong normative claims ("I contend that...")
- **Avoid:** "We believe..." unless co-authored

### Present Tense for Law

Describe legal rules in the "eternal present":

**Correct:** "The Colorado AI Act requires deployers to conduct impact assessments."

**Incorrect:** "The Colorado AI Act required deployers to conduct impact assessments."

Use past tense for historical facts only.

## Structure

### Standard Five-Part Structure

```
I.    INTRODUCTION (5-10%)
II.   BACKGROUND (15-25%)
III.  THE PROBLEM / ANALYSIS (30-40%)
IV.   THE SOLUTION / PROPOSAL (20-30%)
V.    CONCLUSION (2-5%)
```

### Introduction Elements

1. **Opening hook** — Concrete example, puzzle, or stakes
2. **Problem statement** — What issue this addresses
3. **Thesis** — One sentence stating your argument
4. **Contribution** — Why this matters; what's new
5. **Roadmap** — Brief preview of structure

**Example hook patterns:**

*Concrete example:*
> "On December 22, 2025, the FTC voted to vacate its consent order against Rytr LLC. Three days earlier, New York signed the RAISE Act. Same week—opposite directions."

*Puzzle:*
> "Agency law assumes principals can control their agents. But what happens when the agent is an AI system that learns and acts in ways its principal never anticipated?"

*Stakes:*
> "Who is liable when an autonomous AI causes harm? The answer will shape a trillion-dollar industry—and current doctrine provides no clear answer."

### Section Allocation

For a 20,000-word article:

| Section | Words | Pages | % |
|---------|-------|-------|---|
| Introduction | 1,500 | 4 | 7.5% |
| Background | 4,000 | 10 | 20% |
| Analysis | 7,000 | 18 | 35% |
| Proposal | 5,000 | 13 | 25% |
| Objections | 1,500 | 4 | 7.5% |
| Conclusion | 1,000 | 3 | 5% |

### Background Section

Provide context the reader needs—no more.

**Structure options:**

*Technical-Legal Split:*
```
A. Understanding [Technology]
B. The Legal Framework
```

*Historical Arc:*
```
A. The Traditional Rule
B. Early Challenges
C. Current State
```

**Pitfall:** Don't let background bloat. If readers could find this elsewhere, summarize.

### Analysis Section

This is where your contribution lives. Spend the most time here.

**Structure options:**

*Issue-by-Issue:*
```
A. Issue One
   1. Traditional Approach
   2. Why It Fails
   3. Illustrative Examples
B. Issue Two
   [Same structure]
```

*Factor-by-Factor:*
```
A. Factor One
B. Factor Two
C. The Net Result
```

### Proposal Section

Must be concrete. Vague calls for "more research" or "balanced approaches" are insufficient.

**Types of proposals:**

| Type | Example |
|------|---------|
| Doctrinal evolution | "Courts should interpret [doctrine] to include [application]" |
| Statutory reform | "Congress should enact [specific provision]" |
| New framework | "I propose a three-factor test for [problem]" |
| Best practices | "Companies should adopt [specific practices]" |

### Conclusion

Keep it short. Do not introduce new arguments.

**Required elements:**
1. Restate thesis (different words)
2. Summarize key arguments
3. Call to action or forward-looking statement

## Headings

### Numbering System

```
I.    MAJOR SECTION (All Caps)
      A. Subsection (Initial Caps, Italics)
         1. Sub-subsection (Initial Caps)
            a. Paragraph-level (lowercase)
```

### Action Headings Preferred

| Topic (Weak) | Action (Strong) |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Background" | "AI Systems Present Novel Liability Questions" |
| "The Colorado Approach" | "Colorado Allocates Risk to Deployers" |
| "Analysis" | "Current Doctrine Cannot Accommodate Agentic AI" |

## Scholarly Contribution

### The Five Criteria (Volokh)

Your article must be:
1. **Novel** — Not said before
2. **Nonobvious** — Not immediately apparent
3. **Useful** — Matters to someone
4. **Sound** — Logically and legally valid
5. **Seen as such** — Readers recognize it

### Testing Your Thesis

Ask: "If I change my proposal, do different cases come out differently?" If not, refine until the answer is yes.

### Literature Engagement

- Acknowledge prior scholarship explicitly
- Position your contribution against existing work
- Distinguish your approach from alternatives
- Cite critics before addressing objections

---

## Style Conventions

### Quotations

**Under 50 words:** Run into text with quotation marks.

**50+ words:** Block quote, indented, no quotation marks.

**Alterations:**
- Brackets for changes: "The [FTC] vacated the order"
- Ellipses for omissions: "The court held . . . that liability extends"

### Numbers and Lists

- Spell out one through ninety-nine
- Numerals for 100+ and percentages
- Use lists sparingly; they can feel unprofessional
- Maintain parallel structure in lists

### Common Errors

| Error | Correct |
|-------|---------|
| "comprised of" | "comprising" or "composed of" |
| "impact" as verb | "affect" |
| "utilize" | "use" |
| varying terms for same concept | consistent terminology |

---

## AI Governance-Specific

### Terminology Precision

| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| Developer | Entity that creates AI systems |
| Deployer | Entity that uses AI systems |
| Foundation model | Large model trained on broad data |
| Agentic AI | AI that takes autonomous actions |

### Avoid Anthropomorphizing

**Avoid:** "The AI decided to recommend..."

**Prefer:** "The AI system generated a recommendation..."

### Neutrality on Government

Never characterize government positions as "wrong." Frame as "tensions," "challenges," or "competing approaches."
