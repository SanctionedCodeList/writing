# Objective Style

Use for neutral analysis that informs decisions without advocacy: legal memos, research reports, due diligence analysis.

## Voice & Tone

- Present balanced analysis; acknowledge counterarguments fairly
- Avoid advocacy language ("clearly," "obviously," "undoubtedly")
- Write with professional detachment; let facts and analysis speak
- Report what the law is, not what you wish it were

---

## Confidence Signals

Signal certainty levels explicitly:

| Level | Meaning | Example |
|-------|---------|---------|
| **High** | Multiple corroborating sources, established law | "The contract is enforceable." |
| **Medium** | Single source, reasonable inference | "The contract is likely enforceable." |
| **Low** | Estimate, significant assumptions | "The contract may be enforceable, but..." |

**Example with confidence tag:**
> Revenue estimate: $15-20M (MEDIUM confidence—derived from public segment data; no product-level disclosure)

---

## Fact vs. Inference

Label when inferring rather than reporting established facts:

- **Fact:** "PULS acquired Adelsystem in 2024"
- **Inference:** "This acquisition suggests DC-UPS is a strategic priority"

Distinguish:
- Established facts (documented, undisputed)
- Disputed facts (note the dispute and sources)
- Inferences (your analysis based on facts)

## Structure

### Legal Memo Format

```
TO:      [Supervising Attorney]
FROM:    [Your Name]
DATE:    [Date]
RE:      [Client Name] — [Subject]

QUESTION PRESENTED
[Single sentence framing the legal issue]

BRIEF ANSWER
[1-2 paragraph answer—lead with conclusion]

STATEMENT OF FACTS
[Relevant facts, objectively stated]

DISCUSSION
[IRAC/CRAC analysis]

CONCLUSION
[Summary and recommendation]
```

### IRAC Analysis

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Issue** | State the legal question |
| **Rule** | State applicable law |
| **Analysis** | Apply law to facts |
| **Conclusion** | Answer the question |

**Use CRAC (Conclusion-Rule-Analysis-Conclusion) to lead with the answer:**

```
CONCLUSION: The contract is likely enforceable.

RULE: Under New York law, a contract requires offer, acceptance,
consideration, and mutual assent. Smith v. Jones, 123 N.Y.2d 456.

ANALYSIS: Here, Seller made a written offer on January 15, Buyer
accepted in writing on January 20, and both parties exchanged value...

CONCLUSION: Because all elements are satisfied, the contract is
likely enforceable.
```

## Balance and Fairness

### Present Both Sides

Unlike persuasive writing, memos must address counterarguments substantively:

- State the strongest counterargument in its best form
- Don't dismiss or minimize opposing views
- Assess strengths and weaknesses of each position
- Reach a conclusion, but acknowledge uncertainty

### Avoid Hidden Advocacy

Watch for:
- Word choices that subtly favor one side
- Asymmetric treatment of arguments
- Omitting unfavorable authority
- Overstating the strength of favorable cases

---

## Risk Assessment

For due diligence and risk analysis:

### Frame Risks Clearly

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Litigation challenge | Medium | High | Negotiated indemnity |
| Regulatory approval delay | Low | Medium | Parallel track filing |

### Quantify Where Possible

- "Litigation risk: 20-30% probability of adverse ruling"
- "Estimated exposure: $500K-$2M"
- "Timeline impact: 3-6 month potential delay"

### Distinguish Risk Types

- **Legal risk:** Uncertainty about law
- **Factual risk:** Uncertainty about facts
- **Execution risk:** Uncertainty about implementation
- **Business risk:** Uncertainty about outcomes

## Organizing Complex Analysis

### By Issue

```
I. Issue One: Is the contract enforceable?
   A. Elements of enforceability
   B. Application to facts
   C. Conclusion

II. Issue Two: What damages are recoverable?
   A. Measure of damages
   B. Application to facts
   C. Conclusion
```

### By Argument (For Litigation Analysis)

```
I. Plaintiff's likely arguments
   A. Argument One
   B. Argument Two

II. Defendant's likely defenses
   A. Defense One
   B. Defense Two

III. Assessment of likely outcome
```

## Tables for Data-Heavy Content

Use tables to organize:
- Multi-factor tests
- Jurisdiction comparisons
- Timeline of events
- Risk matrices

**Example: Multi-Factor Analysis**

| Factor | Weight | Favorable? | Notes |
|--------|--------|------------|-------|
| Intent | High | Yes | Clear documentary evidence |
| Reliance | Medium | Mixed | Partial performance |
| Harm | High | Yes | Quantifiable damages |

---

## Actionable Guidance

### Close with Recommendations

Don't end with summaries. End with what the reader should do:

**Weak closing:**
> In conclusion, the analysis above suggests the contract may be enforceable under the relevant factors.

**Strong closing:**
> Recommend proceeding with the transaction. The contract is likely enforceable. To mitigate the integration risk identified above, negotiate a $500K holdback and secure retention agreements before signing.

### Identify Next Steps

- What decisions need to be made?
- What additional information would help?
- What are the deadlines?
