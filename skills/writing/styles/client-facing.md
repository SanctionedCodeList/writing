# Client-Facing Style

Use when communicating with clients who need clear, actionable information: advice letters, status updates, risk assessments, recommendations.

## Voice & Tone

- **Empathetic and confident** — Acknowledge concerns without creating panic
- **Direct** — Lead with what matters most
- **Jargon-free** — Translate legal terms; define unavoidable terminology
- **Professional** — Warm but not casual

### Pronouns

- Use **"you/your"** for guidance to the client
- Use **"we/our"** for actions counsel will take
- Use the client's name or company name when appropriate

---

## Lead with What Matters

### The Client's Question

Every communication should answer the client's implicit question: **"What do I need to know, and what do I need to do?"**

**Weak opening:**
> We have completed our analysis of the regulatory implications of the proposed transaction structure as discussed in our meeting on January 15...

**Strong opening:**
> The proposed structure works, but requires one modification: the licensing agreement must be signed before the asset transfer. Here's what that means for your timeline.

### The "So What?" Test

After each paragraph, ask: "So what does this mean for the client?" If you can't answer, either explain the significance or cut the paragraph.

## Translating Legal Concepts

### Define Unavoidable Terms

When you must use legal terms, define them immediately:

> The contract includes a "liquidated damages" clause—a pre-agreed penalty amount if either party breaches. This clause caps your exposure at $50,000.

### Use Analogies

> Think of the indemnification clause like insurance: if something goes wrong, the seller covers your costs up to $2 million.

### Avoid Unnecessary Jargon

| Legal Term | Client-Friendly |
|------------|-----------------|
| "pursuant to" | "under" |
| "heretofore" | "previously" |
| "notwithstanding" | "despite" or "even if" |
| "material adverse change" | "significant negative event" |
| "representations and warranties" | "promises about the facts" |

---

## Risk Communication

### Frame Risks Clearly

Don't bury risks or over-explain. State them directly:

> **Risk:** If the supplier doesn't deliver by March 1, you'll miss your launch date.
>
> **Likelihood:** Medium—the supplier has been late twice in the past year.
>
> **Mitigation:** Add a penalty clause to the contract and identify a backup supplier.

### Calibrate Alarm

| Situation | Tone |
|-----------|------|
| Low risk, routine | Neutral, brief |
| Moderate risk | Clear explanation, options |
| High risk | Urgent but professional, specific recommendations |
| Crisis | Direct, action-oriented, escalation path |

### Avoid

- **Alarmism:** "This could be catastrophic" (unless it actually could be)
- **Over-hedging:** "It's possible that there might potentially be some risk"
- **False certainty:** "There's no risk here" (there's always some risk)

## Structuring Client Communications

### Status Updates

```
1. Bottom Line (1-2 sentences)
   What's the current status? On track or not?

2. Progress Since Last Update
   What happened? (Bullet points)

3. Issues/Risks
   What should the client know about?

4. Next Steps
   What happens next? Who does what by when?

5. Questions for Client
   Do you need a decision or input?
```

### Advice Letters

```
1. Summary/Recommendation
   What should they do?

2. Background
   What's the situation? (Brief)

3. Analysis
   Why this recommendation?

4. Risks and Alternatives
   What could go wrong? Other options?

5. Action Items
   Specific next steps with deadlines
```

## Actionability

### Every Communication Needs Action Items

**Weak closing:**
> Please let us know if you have any questions.

**Strong closing:**
> **Action items:**
> - [ ] Sign the NDA by Friday (attached)
> - [ ] Provide the customer list by January 20 so we can assess IP issues
> - [ ] Schedule a call next week to discuss the timeline
>
> Let me know if you have questions about any of these items.

### Be Specific About Who/What/When

| Vague | Specific |
|-------|----------|
| "We should discuss this soon" | "Let's schedule a call for Thursday to discuss" |
| "You'll need to provide some documents" | "Please send the 2023 financials and customer contracts by January 15" |
| "There may be some issues" | "Two issues need resolution: the non-compete scope and the payment terms" |

---

## Documenting Decisions

### Confirm Client Instructions

When clients make decisions, confirm in writing:

> Per our call today, you've decided to proceed with Option A (the asset purchase) rather than Option B (the stock purchase). This means [brief explanation of implications]. Please confirm this is correct.

### Flag Risks of Client Choices

If a client chooses a riskier path, document your advice:

> As discussed, we recommend Option A. You've chosen Option B, which carries the additional risk of [X]. We understand your reasons [brief acknowledgment of their reasoning], and we'll proceed as directed.

## Tone Calibration

### By Relationship Stage

| Stage | Tone |
|-------|------|
| New client | More formal, more explanation |
| Established relationship | Efficient, assumes context |
| Crisis | Direct, calm, action-focused |
| Good news | Warm, congratulatory (briefly) |
| Bad news | Empathetic but clear |

### By Client Sophistication

| Client Type | Adjust |
|-------------|--------|
| Sophisticated in-house counsel | Less explanation, more analysis |
| Business executive | Focus on business implications |
| First-time client | More context, define terms |
| Technical expert (non-legal) | Bridge legal and technical concepts |
