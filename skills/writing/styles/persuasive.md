# Persuasive Style

Use when advocating for a position to a decision-maker: briefs, motions, advocacy documents.

## Voice & Tone

- Write with confident advocacy while maintaining credibility
- Frame issues to favor your position from the first sentence
- Use syllogistic reasoning: major premise → minor premise → conclusion
- Anchor arguments in authority before deploying policy/equity
- **Minimize emotional language**—research shows less emotional language correlates with significantly higher win rates

---

## The Opening

You have seconds to capture attention. First sentences matter disproportionately.

### Effective Hooks

| Type | Example | Use For |
|------|---------|---------|
| Question | "What happens when an agency claims authority Congress never granted?" | Issue framing |
| Statement | "The government's position would criminalize ordinary business decisions." | Stakes elevation |
| Scene | "On March 15, 2024, federal agents arrived at 5 a.m." | Factual narratives |

### Avoid

- "This case involves..."
- Procedural recitation as opening
- Abstract legal concepts before stakes
- Throat-clearing

Keep opening sentences under 10 words when possible.

---

## Framing Techniques

- Lead each section with the governing rule, then apply facts
- Compare precedent facts to your record facts explicitly
- State legally significant distinctions, not mere factual differences
- Use party names ("Ms. Chen") to humanize your client
- Keep adversary abstract ("Defendant")
- Let adverse facts speak through concrete detail, not adjectives

---

## Argument Selection

### The Kitchen Sink Problem

Raising every possible argument signals lack of confidence. Research shows weak arguments damage strong ones.

**The averaging effect:** When readers encounter strong and weak arguments, they average them. A brilliant argument surrounded by mediocre ones becomes merely good.

**Optimal issue count:** 3-4 maximum. Beyond that, arguments get diluted.

**The discipline:**
- Identify all possible arguments
- Rank by strength
- Keep only those that meaningfully advance your position
- If an argument wouldn't warrant its own section, cut it

---

## Argument Ordering

### Primacy Effect

Lead with your strongest argument. First impressions shape how readers interpret everything that follows.

### Anchoring

State damages figures early and confidently. Frame the legal standard in your terms first.

### Recency Effect

End memorably. The final paragraph should deliver impact, not boilerplate.

**Structure:** Strong opening (primacy) → supporting arguments → strong close (recency). Bury necessary-but-weaker points in the middle.

---

## Handling Weaknesses

### The Defang Technique

Never ignore weaknesses. Acknowledge and pivot:

- **Placement**: Bury unfavorable facts mid-paragraph, between favorable facts
- **Proportion**: Spend less time; don't repeat unfavorable facts
- **Context**: Provide context that reduces damage
- **Transition**: Use acknowledgment as springboard to your strongest point

### Inoculation

Preemptively addressing counterarguments builds resistance—like a vaccine.

**The two-step process:**
1. **Threat**: Signal the challenge is worth addressing
2. **Refutation**: Raise the counterargument and refute it before opponent does

**When to inoculate:**
- Strong opposing arguments the court will certainly encounter
- Adverse precedent that cannot be ignored
- Unfavorable facts central to the dispute

**When NOT to inoculate:**
- Weak arguments opponent may not raise
- Tangential issues that distract
- Points better left unmentioned

Never raise a counterargument without an effective response.

---

## Narrative Engagement

### Creating Forward Momentum

**Curiosity**: "What happens next?" Create through:
- A central dramatic question
- Section endings that foreshadow
- Strategic withholding

**Concern**: "What will happen to this person?" Create through:
- Using party names
- Showing agency and choices
- Making stakes concrete

### Maintaining Tension

Signal the case could go either way. A brief that feels inevitable is a brief readers stop reading.

- Acknowledge the other side's arguments before dismantling
- Escalate stakes as brief progresses
- Frame as collision between legitimate interests

---

## Headings

### Complete Sentences That Advance Theory

Each heading should be a proposition the reader can accept.

| Topic (Weak) | Action (Strong) |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Background" | "The Agency Exceeded Its Statutory Authority" |
| "Analysis" | "Chevron Deference Does Not Apply" |
| "Conclusion" | "The Order Should Be Vacated" |

### Roadmap Paragraphs

Preview argument structure at the start of each major section.

---

## Pacing

Vary sentence length for impact:

**For urgency:**
> The statute is clear. It requires notice. The agency provided none.

**For complexity:**
> While the agency contends informal communication satisfied the requirement, the text, history, and regulations all point to a more formal process—one undisputedly not followed.

**General:** Average 18-22 words, but vary deliberately.

## Understatement Over Overstatement

### The Empirical Case

A study of 1,677 Supreme Court cases found briefs with minimal emotional language won significantly more often:
- Petitioners: 29% increase in win probability
- Respondents: 100% increase in win probability

The effect was almost triple the impact of oral argument experience.

### What to Avoid

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "egregious," "outrageous," "shocking" | Let facts demonstrate severity |
| "clearly," "obviously," "plainly" | State propositions with confidence |
| "frivolous," "absurd," "ridiculous" | Explain why the argument fails |
| "disingenuous," "bad faith" | Describe conduct factually |

### Why Emotional Language Backfires

- Signals lack of substantive arguments
- Triggers skepticism in trained legal readers
- Undermines credibility (ethos) that makes logic persuasive
- Makes you appear desperate rather than confident

Credibility is your primary asset. Let facts speak.

---

## Cognitive Triggers

| Trigger | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Authority** | Lead with binding precedent; cite respected treatises |
| **Social proof** | Note how other courts ruled; cite industry standards |
| **Consistency** | Frame as extension of established principles |
| **Reciprocity** | Acknowledge valid opposing points before pivoting |

---

## The Story Sandwich

Structure for maximum persuasion:

1. **Open with story** (pathos) — Hook with human stakes
2. **Anchor in authority** (ethos) — Establish legal framework
3. **Build logical structure** (logos) — CREAC analysis
4. **Return to stakes** (pathos) — Close with what's at stake
