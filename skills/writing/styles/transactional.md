# Transactional Style

Use for contracts, agreements, and deal documents where every word carries legal weight.

## Voice & Tone

- **Precise and unambiguous** — Every word matters
- **Neutral** — Unless drafting for one side
- **Formal** — Appropriate to binding legal obligations
- **Future-oriented** — Anticipate disputes and edge cases

---

## Definitions Discipline

### Core Rules

1. **Define before using** — First use should include or follow the definition
2. **One concept per term** — Don't hide obligations in definitions
3. **Maintain a definitions section** — Alphabetize for reference
4. **Use "means" for definitions** — Not "includes" (unless intentionally non-exhaustive)

### Definition Patterns

**Exhaustive:**
> "Business Day" means any day other than a Saturday, Sunday, or federal holiday.

**Non-exhaustive:**
> "Intellectual Property" includes patents, copyrights, trademarks, and trade secrets.

### Avoid Hidden Obligations

**Bad (obligation buried in definition):**
> "Confidential Information" means any information that the Receiving Party protects with reasonable care...

**Good (obligation separate):**
> "Confidential Information" means any non-public information disclosed by either party.
>
> Section 4.2: The Receiving Party shall protect Confidential Information with reasonable care...

## Drafting Conventions

### Tense

| Use | For |
|-----|-----|
| Present tense | Ongoing obligations ("shall pay") |
| Future tense | Contingent events ("will occur if") |

### Obligation Words

| Word | Meaning | Example |
|------|---------|---------|
| **shall** | Obligation | "Seller shall deliver the goods" |
| **may** | Permission | "Buyer may inspect the goods" |
| **will** | Future fact | "Closing will occur on March 1" |
| **must** | Condition | "Buyer must pay before title transfers" |

### Avoid

- **Provisos** ("provided that") — Restructure as conditions or exceptions
- **Shall-nots** — Reframe as affirmative obligations where possible
- **Double negatives** — Creates ambiguity
- **And/or** — Choose one; if both needed, say "A, B, or both"

---

## Risk Allocation

### Make Allocation Explicit

Don't rely on implication. State who bears what risk:

> Seller bears the risk of loss until delivery. After delivery, Buyer bears all risk.

### Define Consequences

For each obligation, consider:
- What happens on breach?
- What's the cure period?
- What notice is required?
- What survives termination?

### Distinguish Provisions

| Type | Consequence of Breach |
|------|----------------------|
| **Representation** | Indemnification; rescission |
| **Warranty** | Indemnification; repair/replace |
| **Covenant** | Damages; specific performance |
| **Condition** | Non-occurrence excuses performance |

## Structure

### Standard Contract Structure

```
1. PREAMBLE
   - Party identification
   - Effective date
   - Recitals ("WHEREAS" clauses)

2. DEFINITIONS
   - Alphabetized defined terms

3. OPERATIVE PROVISIONS
   - Transaction mechanics
   - Rights and obligations
   - Organized by subject

4. REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES
   - Seller reps
   - Buyer reps
   - Mutual reps

5. COVENANTS
   - Pre-closing covenants
   - Post-closing covenants

6. CONDITIONS PRECEDENT
   - Conditions to Seller's obligations
   - Conditions to Buyer's obligations

7. INDEMNIFICATION
   - Seller indemnity
   - Buyer indemnity
   - Procedures and limitations

8. TERMINATION
   - Termination rights
   - Effect of termination

9. GENERAL PROVISIONS
   - Governing law
   - Dispute resolution
   - Assignment
   - Notices
   - Amendment
   - Severability
   - Entire agreement
   - Counterparts

10. SIGNATURE BLOCKS

11. EXHIBITS AND SCHEDULES
```

### Numbering Convention

```
ARTICLE I — DEFINITIONS
   Section 1.1   Defined Terms
      (a) "Agreement" means...
      (b) "Business Day" means...
         (i) in New York...
         (ii) in London...
```

---

## Cross-References

### Be Precise

**Vague:**
> Subject to the terms of this Agreement...

**Precise:**
> Subject to Section 4.2(b)...

### Avoid Circularity

Check that definitions don't create circular references:
- Term A defined using Term B
- Term B defined using Term A

### Update on Revision

When changing section numbers, search for and update all cross-references.

---

## Boilerplate

### Don't Skip These

Even "standard" provisions matter:

| Provision | Why It Matters |
|-----------|----------------|
| **Entire agreement** | Excludes prior negotiations |
| **Amendment** | Requires written changes |
| **Severability** | Saves contract if provision fails |
| **Governing law** | Determines interpretation |
| **Dispute resolution** | Litigation vs. arbitration |
| **Notices** | How parties communicate |
| **Assignment** | Who can transfer rights |

### Customize for Deal

Boilerplate isn't one-size-fits-all:
- Multi-party deals need different notice provisions
- International deals need careful governing law analysis
- Long-term relationships may need different amendment procedures

## Ambiguity Checklist

Review for common ambiguity sources:

- [ ] **Antecedent clarity** — "It" and "they" have clear referents
- [ ] **Modifier placement** — Adjectives modify intended words
- [ ] **List construction** — "A, B, and C" vs. "A and B, and C"
- [ ] **Temporal terms** — "Within 30 days" of what trigger?
- [ ] **Defined terms** — Used consistently and correctly
- [ ] **Cross-references** — All valid and updated

---

## Checklist

- [ ] Definitions alphabetized and complete
- [ ] No obligations hidden in definitions
- [ ] "Shall" used only for obligations
- [ ] Risk allocation explicit
- [ ] Consequences for breach defined
- [ ] Survival terms specified
- [ ] Cross-references accurate
