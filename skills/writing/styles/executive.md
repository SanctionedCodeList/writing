# Executive Style

Use for business documents where busy decision-makers need clear recommendations: reports, decks, board materials, executive summaries, consulting deliverables.

## Core Principle: Lead with the Answer

Executives don't have time to follow your reasoning journey. State conclusions first, then support them.

**Traditional (burying the lead):**
```
1. Background
2. Methodology
3. Findings
4. Analysis
5. Conclusion  ← Reader finally gets the answer on page 20
```

**Executive style (Pyramid Principle):**
```
1. Recommendation  ← Answer in first paragraph
2. Supporting Argument 1
3. Supporting Argument 2
4. Supporting Argument 3
5. Appendix (detailed methodology, data)
```

## Action Headings

Action headings are the single most impactful improvement for executive documents. They state conclusions, not topics.

| Topic (Weak) | Action (Strong) |
|--------------|-----------------|
| Market Analysis | Market growing 15% annually, driven by cloud adoption |
| Financial Results | Q3 revenue beat targets by 12% on enterprise strength |
| Competitive Landscape | Three competitors control 70%—consolidation accelerating |
| Recommendation | Proceed with acquisition at proposed $50M valuation |

### Rules for Action Headings

1. **Maximum 15 words** — Must fit on 1-2 lines
2. **Complete thought** — Understandable without reading the section
3. **Quantify when possible** — Include numbers, percentages, timeframes
4. **Active voice** — Subject → Verb → Object
5. **Insight, not summary** — "Market favors consolidation" not "We analyzed the market"

### The Storyline Test

Write all headings in a list. Read in sequence. If someone reading only headings understands your complete argument, you've succeeded.

**Example:**
```
1. European market opportunity exceeds $500M annually
2. We're positioned to win with existing product
3. Competition is fragmented—no clear leader
4. Entry risk manageable with phased approach
5. $25M investment yields 4x return over three years
6. Recommend Board approval for Q2 entry
```

## MECE Organization

Content should be **Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive**:
- **Mutually Exclusive** — No overlap between categories
- **Collectively Exhaustive** — Nothing important left out

**Bad (not MECE):**
- Increase revenue
- Cut costs
- Improve marketing ← overlaps with revenue
- Reduce headcount ← overlaps with costs

**Good (MECE):**
- Increase revenue (3 initiatives)
- Reduce costs (2 initiatives)
- Improve capital efficiency (1 initiative)

## Executive Summaries

### The 10% Rule

Executive summary should be ~10% of document length. For a 30-page report, 3 pages.

### Write Last

Write the executive summary after completing the full document.

### SCQA Structure

| Element | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Situation** | Establish shared context | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Complication** | Introduce tension/problem | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Question** | Frame what must be answered | Often implicit |
| **Answer** | Your recommendation | Rest of summary |

### Standalone Comprehension

The executive summary must be readable without the full document. Include:
- The recommendation
- Key supporting points (3-5 bullets)
- Specific next steps
