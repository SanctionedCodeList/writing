# Expert Report Style

Use when writing expert witness reports for litigation: damages analysis, technical opinions, medical causation, forensic findings, industry standard of care.

## Core Principle

An expert report serves two masters: it must withstand Daubert scrutiny and persuade the trier of fact. The methodology must be bulletproof; the prose must be clear. Credibility accounts for 23-50% of outcome variance in studies—lose it anywhere, lose it everywhere.

## Voice & Tone

- **Objective authority**: You educate, not advocate. Leave argument to counsel.
- **Confident but bounded**: State opinions firmly within methodological limits. "To a reasonable degree of professional certainty" means >50% probability, not absolute.
- **Accessible expertise**: Write for an intelligent layperson, not a peer reviewer. Define technical terms.
- **First person for opinions**: "I conducted..." and "In my opinion..." signal ownership.

## Rule 26(a)(2)(B) Requirements

Every retained expert report in federal court must include:

1. **Complete statement of all opinions** with basis and reasons
2. **Facts or data considered** (not just relied upon—everything reviewed)
3. **Exhibits** that summarize or support opinions
4. **Qualifications** including publications (past 10 years)
5. **Prior testimony** list (past 4 years)
6. **Compensation** statement

**Critical**: If an opinion isn't in the report, you likely cannot testify to it. Disclose everything.

## Report Structure

### Recommended Organization

1. **Introduction and Assignment**
   - Purpose of engagement
   - Issues addressed
   - One-paragraph summary of conclusions

2. **Qualifications**
   - Credentials relevant to *these specific opinions*
   - Experience that establishes you as qualified for this case
   - Attach full CV as exhibit

3. **Materials Reviewed**
   - List everything considered (documents, data, depositions)
   - Use Bates numbers where available
   - Distinguish "reviewed" from "relied upon" if needed

4. **Methodology**
   - Explain approach before presenting analysis
   - Cite peer-reviewed standards or accepted practices
   - Address why this methodology fits these facts
   - Note limitations

5. **Factual Background**
   - Relevant facts from the record
   - Presented neutrally—let facts speak

6. **Analysis**
   - Apply methodology to facts
   - Show your work step by step
   - Address contrary evidence—don't ignore it

7. **Opinions**
   - Number each opinion separately
   - State opinion in one clear sentence, then explain basis
   - Connect each opinion to supporting analysis

8. **Summary**
   - Recapitulate key findings
   - Signature and date

9. **Appendices**
   - Calculations, data tables, supporting exhibits
   - CV, publications list, prior testimony list
   - Compensation statement

## Methodology Section

The methodology section is where Daubert challenges succeed or fail.

### What Courts Assess (Daubert Factors)

| Factor | How to Address |
|--------|----------------|
| **Testability** | Can the method be tested? Has it been? |
| **Peer review** | Is it published and vetted by the field? |
| **Error rate** | What's the known or potential error rate? |
| **Standards** | Are there controlling standards? Do you follow them? |
| **General acceptance** | Is the method accepted in your field? |

### Documentation Requirements

- Name the methodology explicitly
- Cite authoritative sources (not just your own publications)
- Explain why this method suits these facts
- If multiple valid approaches exist, explain your selection
- Acknowledge limitations—hiding them invites attack

### The 2023 Rule 702 Amendment

The December 2023 amendment clarifies that the proponent must demonstrate reliability by a **preponderance of the evidence**. Courts can no longer treat reliability as "weight for the jury." Reports must now more robustly explain methodology.

---

## Opinion Formulation

### State Opinions Clearly

Each opinion should:
- Begin with a clear declarative statement
- Include the standard of certainty ("to a reasonable degree of [professional] certainty")
- Connect explicitly to the methodology and facts supporting it

**Example structure**:
> **Opinion 1**: The defendant's product contained a design defect that caused the plaintiff's injury.
>
> *Basis*: I reached this conclusion based on [methodology] applied to [facts]. The analysis shows [reasoning]. This opinion is stated to a reasonable degree of engineering certainty.

### "Reasonable Certainty" Defined

- Most judges interpret this as "more likely than not" (>50%)
- Most experts interpret it as >90% confidence
- Bridge the gap: explain what level of confidence your methodology provides
- "Reasonable probability" is increasingly accepted as equivalent

### Defensive Writing

- Support opinions with multiple data points where possible
- Address evidence that cuts against your opinion and explain why it doesn't change your conclusion
- Include a caveat that opinions may change if new information emerges
- Stay within your expertise—flag when other specialists are needed

---

## Writing for Cross-Examination

Everything in the report is ammunition for opposing counsel. Write defensively.

### Avoid These Vulnerabilities

| Vulnerability | Why It's Dangerous |
|--------------|-------------------|
| Absolute language ("always," "never") | One counterexample destroys credibility |
| Conclusory statements | "Because I said so" fails Daubert |
| Overgeneralizations | Opposing counsel will find exceptions |
| Inconsistency with prior work | Prior publications and testimony are fair game |
| Gaps between data and conclusions | The "analytical gap" is a common exclusion ground |

### Language Discipline

| Avoid | Use Instead |
|-------|-------------|
| "Clearly negligent" | State facts; let counsel argue negligence |
| "Obviously defective" | Describe the defect; explain why it matters |
| "The defendant knew" | "The evidence shows..." (unless you have direct proof) |
| "It is well known that" | Cite the authority |

### Before Submitting

Scrutinize every sentence: How could opposing counsel twist this? If you can imagine the cross-examination question, revise.

## Handling Contrary Evidence

Ignoring contrary evidence is fatal. Courts exclude experts who cherry-pick.

### The Requirement

Under FRE 702 and Daubert, methodology must be reliably applied. Selective use of data isn't reliable application.

### Approach

1. Acknowledge the contrary evidence exists
2. Explain why it doesn't change your conclusion:
   - Different methodology
   - Different facts
   - Limitations in the contrary data
   - Weight of evidence favors your position
3. Never pretend it doesn't exist

**Example**:
> I considered Dr. Smith's contrary findings. However, Dr. Smith's analysis used [different methodology/data]. When applying [my methodology] to the same data, the results support my opinion because [reason].

## State Court Considerations

### Daubert vs. Frye

| Standard | States | Focus |
|----------|--------|-------|
| **Daubert** | ~40 states + federal | Reliability factors, flexible inquiry |
| **Frye** | CA, IL, NY, PA, WA, MN | "General acceptance" in scientific community |

In **Frye jurisdictions**, emphasize:
- Community acceptance of your methodology
- Cite peer-reviewed literature heavily
- Avoid novel approaches without strong acceptance evidence

### Disclosure Variations

| Jurisdiction | Key Difference |
|--------------|----------------|
| **Federal** | Full signed report required (Rule 26) |
| **California** | Attorney declaration, no expert signature |
| **New York** | Summary disclosure, no formal report |
| **Texas** | Mirrors federal post-2021 |
| **Florida** | Via interrogatories, no routine report |

When writing for state court, verify local requirements. The structure in this guide works for federal court and adapts to most states.

## Discipline-Specific Considerations

### Financial/Damages Experts

- Follow USPAP or AICPA standards
- Document discount rate derivation
- Address "but-for" world construction
- Show sensitivity analysis on key assumptions

### Medical Experts

- Distinguish general causation (can it cause this injury?) from specific causation (did it cause this injury?)
- Differential diagnosis alone doesn't establish general causation
- Rule out alternative causes, including idiopathic
- Match your specialty to the case

### Technical/Engineering Experts

- Define POSITA (person of ordinary skill in the art) in patent cases
- Document testing conditions and replication
- Reference applicable standards (ASTM, SAE, FMVSS)

### Forensic Experts

- Repeatability is paramount—another examiner should reach the same result
- Document chain of custody
- Disclose tool versions and validation
- Use standardized conclusion terminology

### Economic Experts

- Explain model specification choices
- Document data sources and cleaning
- Address omitted variable bias
- Show robustness to alternative specifications

---

## Visual Aids

### When to Use

- Complex data requiring comparison
- Timelines of events
- Technical processes benefiting from illustration
- Financial calculations

### Design Principles

- Each visual must add value, not decoration
- Make all elements large and readable
- Use clear labels; explain in text before displaying
- Build complexity progressively
- Keep complex or low-quality visuals in appendices

### Integration

Describe each visual in the text before presenting it. Never drop in a figure without context.

---

## Formatting Standards

- **Font**: 11-12 point minimum
- **Spacing**: 1.5 lines (not single-spaced)
- **Headings**: Clear hierarchy with topic headings
- **Length**: No arbitrary limit, but concision matters
- **Table of contents**: Required for reports over 25-30 pages
- **Page numbers**: All pages, including appendices
- **Signature**: Expert must sign (federal court)

---

## Common Grounds for Exclusion

Learn from others' failures:

| Ground | What Went Wrong |
|--------|-----------------|
| **Ipse dixit** | Opinion without adequate explanation |
| **Analytical gap** | Data doesn't support conclusions (Joiner) |
| **Unreliable methodology** | Method not tested, peer-reviewed, or accepted |
| **Qualification mismatch** | Expert opined outside their expertise |
| **Insufficient facts** | Opinion based on incomplete or speculative data |
| **Cherry-picking** | Ignored contrary evidence |
| **Exceeding bounds** | Conclusions beyond what methodology supports |
| **Untimely disclosure** | Report submitted late (Rule 37 exclusion) |

---

## Timing Requirements

### Federal Court (Default)

| Disclosure | Deadline |
|------------|----------|
| Initial expert report | 90 days before trial |
| Rebuttal expert report | 30 days after opposing disclosure |
| Supplementation | Through pretrial disclosures |

**Note**: Scheduling orders typically set specific dates that supersede defaults. Calendar carefully.

### Consequences of Late Disclosure

Rule 37(c)(1) provides **automatic exclusion** unless the failure was substantially justified or harmless. Courts consider:
- Explanation for delay
- Importance of testimony
- Prejudice to opponent
- Availability of continuance

Proximity to trial increases prejudice. Don't be late.
