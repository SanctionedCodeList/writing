# Concise Writing

Patterns for cutting words without losing meaning. Use during revision to tighten prose.

## Quick Self-Edit Process

1. **Circle every "of"** — Convert to possessive where possible
2. **Highlight "-tion/-ment/-ity" words** — Convert to verbs
3. **Find "it is/there are"** — Restructure the sentence
4. **Search "in order to"** — Replace with "to"
5. **Count prepositions per sentence** — More than 3 suggests rewriting

## Never Edit Quoted Material

**Do not apply concision edits to:**
- Direct quotes from cases, statutes, or regulations
- Block quotes from any source
- Text in quotation marks
- Parenthetical case descriptions
- Statutory language

If a quote is verbose, either use ellipses, paraphrase, or quote only the essential phrase.

## 1. Redundant Pairs

Legal writing inherited these from an era when English and French terms were paired. Now they're bloat.

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| full and complete | complete |
| each and every | each |
| due and payable | due |
| true and correct | true |
| any and all | any |
| null and void | void |
| cease and desist | stop |
| terms and conditions | terms |
| unless and until | until |
| authorize and empower | authorize |

## 2. Nominalizations → Verbs

Nominalizations add words and drain energy. Convert back to verbs.

| Nominalization | Verb Form | Saved |
|----------------|-----------|-------|
| make a determination | determine | 2 |
| is in violation of | violates | 3 |
| reach a conclusion | conclude | 2 |
| come to an agreement | agree | 3 |
| give consideration to | consider | 2 |
| conduct an investigation | investigate | 2 |
| file an objection | object | 2 |
| had knowledge of | knew | 2 |
| is in compliance with | complies with | 2 |

## 3. Prepositional Phrase Bloat

These phrases add nothing but syllables.

| Wordy | Concise | Saved |
|-------|---------|-------|
| for the reason that | because | 3 |
| in the event that | if | 3 |
| at the present time | now | 3 |
| in order to | to | 2 |
| with regard to | regarding | 2 |
| for the purpose of | to | 3 |
| on the basis of | based on | 2 |
| in spite of the fact that | although | 5 |
| by means of | by | 2 |
| in the absence of | without | 3 |
| prior to | before | 1 |
| subsequent to | after | 1 |

## 4. Throat-Clearing Phrases

Delete entirely. They add no meaning.

| Delete This | Why |
|-------------|-----|
| it is important to note that | If important, readers will notice |
| it should be pointed out that | Just point it out |
| the fact that | Usually deletable |
| it is clear that / clearly | If clear, don't announce it |
| obviously / of course | Condescending and unnecessary |
| needless to say | Then don't say it |
| basically / actually / really / very | Filler |
| in fact | Usually unnecessary |

## 5. Passive → Active Voice

Passive voice hides actors and adds words.

| Passive | Active | Saved |
|---------|--------|-------|
| The motion was filed by Plaintiff | Plaintiff filed the motion | 1 |
| It was held by the court that | The court held | 3 |
| A determination was made by the agency | The agency determined | 3 |
| Notice was provided to Plaintiff | Defendant notified Plaintiff | 2 |

**Pattern:** If you see "was [verb]ed by," flip it.

## 6. "Of" Phrases → Possessives

| Wordy | Concise | Saved |
|-------|---------|-------|
| the negligence of the defendant | the defendant's negligence | 2 |
| the decision of the court | the court's decision | 2 |
| the provisions of the statute | the statute's provisions | 2 |
| the testimony of the witness | the witness's testimony | 2 |

## 7. Weak Verb Constructions → Strong Verbs

| Weak Construction | Strong Verb | Saved |
|-------------------|-------------|-------|
| is an illustration of | illustrates | 3 |
| is a violation of | violates | 3 |
| gave approval to | approved | 2 |
| has the ability to | can | 3 |
| is in agreement with | agrees with | 2 |
| has a tendency to | tends to | 2 |

## 8. Compound Prepositions → Simple

| Compound | Simple |
|----------|--------|
| in accordance with | under / by |
| in addition to | besides |
| in regard to | about |
| with respect to | about / regarding |
| in terms of | [restructure sentence] |
| in excess of | over / more than |

## 9. Legal Jargon Replacements

| Jargon | Plain English |
|--------|---------------|
| pursuant to | under |
| hereinafter | [delete or use "the"] |
| aforementioned | this / that / the |
| said [noun] | the [noun] |
| wherein | where / in which |
| heretofore | previously / before |

## 10. Sentence Combining

Two short sentences often compress into one.

**Before (24 words):**
> The FAC adds two new plaintiffs. These plaintiffs are Benjamin Tate and Stephen Pritchett. They make the same allegations as the original plaintiffs.

**After (15 words):**
> The FAC adds two new plaintiffs—Benjamin Tate and Stephen Pritchett—who make identical allegations.

## 11. Adverb Elimination

Adverbs often signal the verb isn't strong enough.

**Delete entirely:**
- clearly / obviously / plainly
- really / very / extremely / highly
- basically / essentially / fundamentally
- certainly / undoubtedly

**Replace adverb + weak verb with strong verb:**

| Wordy | Concise |
|-------|---------|
| strongly suggests | demonstrates |
| clearly shows | shows |
| completely destroyed | destroyed |
| wholly without merit | without merit |

**Legal red flags:** "clearly established," "plainly erroneous," "utterly fails," "manifestly unjust"—if deleting the adverb doesn't change the meaning, delete it.

## 12. Negative → Affirmative

| Negative | Affirmative |
|----------|-------------|
| did not remember | forgot |
| did not accept | rejected |
| not able to | unable to / cannot |
| does not have | lacks |
| did not comply with | violated |

## Revision Example

**Before (67 words):**
> It is important to note that the First Amended Complaint, which was filed by the Plaintiffs subsequent to the filing of Defendants' motion to dismiss, makes no substantive changes with regard to the allegations that were contained in the original complaint. The FAC is notable for what it fails to allege in connection with the claims that are asserted by the Plaintiffs.

**After (32 words):**
> The First Amended Complaint, filed after Defendants moved to dismiss, makes no substantive changes. The FAC still fails to allege facts supporting Plaintiffs' claims.

**Words saved: 35 (52% reduction)**
