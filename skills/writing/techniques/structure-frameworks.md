# Structure Frameworks

Structure transforms paragraphs into persuasive arguments. These frameworks ensure documents build logically toward conclusions.

## The Pyramid Principle

Barbara Minto's framework from McKinsey: **Lead with the answer, then support it.**

```
                    ┌─────────────────┐
                    │   MAIN POINT    │
                    │   (Answer)      │
                    └────────┬────────┘
           ┌─────────────────┼─────────────────┐
           ▼                 ▼                 ▼
    ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐   ┌─────────────┐
    │ Supporting  │   │ Supporting  │   │ Supporting  │
    │  Argument 1 │   │  Argument 2 │   │  Argument 3 │
    └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘   └──────┬──────┘
           │                 │                 │
         Data             Data             Data
```

### The Three Rules

1. **Start with the answer** — Don't make readers wait
2. **Group and summarize** — Ideas at any level summarize ideas below
3. **Logic within groups** — Ideas are logically ordered

### MECE Requirement

Supporting arguments must be:
- **Mutually Exclusive** — No overlap
- **Collectively Exhaustive** — Nothing important left out

### Logical Ordering

| Order Type | When to Use | Example |
|------------|-------------|---------|
| **Time** | Process, sequence | First... Then... Finally... |
| **Structure** | Geography, organization | North... South... |
| **Importance** | Recommendations | Most critical... Important... |
| **Deductive** | Logical argument | If X and Y, then Z |

## SCQA Framework

The McKinsey standard for business arguments.

| Element | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Situation** | Establish shared context | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Complication** | Introduce tension/problem | 1-2 paragraphs |
| **Question** | Frame what must be answered | Often implicit |
| **Answer** | Your recommendation | Rest of document |

### Example

**Situation:** GlobalTech is #2 in enterprise software with 25% share and $500M revenue. Growth has averaged 12% annually.

**Complication:** Over 18 months, three cloud-native competitors captured 15% of new deals. Win rates dropped from 60% to 35%.

**Question:** How should GlobalTech respond?

**Answer:** Accelerate cloud migration with $50M investment over 18 months.

## IRAC for Legal Documents

The standard framework for legal analysis.

| Element | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Issue** | State the legal question |
| **Rule** | State applicable law |
| **Analysis** | Apply law to facts |
| **Conclusion** | Answer the question |

### CRAC Variation

**CRAC** (Conclusion-Rule-Analysis-Conclusion) leads with the answer:

```
CONCLUSION: The contract is likely enforceable.

RULE: Under New York law, a contract requires offer, acceptance,
consideration, and mutual assent. Smith v. Jones, 123 N.Y.2d 456.

ANALYSIS: Here, Seller made a written offer on January 15, Buyer
accepted in writing on January 20, and both exchanged value...

CONCLUSION: Because all elements are satisfied, the contract is
likely enforceable.
```

### Legal Memo Structure

```
QUESTION PRESENTED
BRIEF ANSWER
STATEMENT OF FACTS
DISCUSSION
  I. [Issue 1 - IRAC analysis]
  II. [Issue 2 - IRAC analysis]
CONCLUSION
```

## Problem-Solution-Benefit

Simple persuasive structure for proposals.

| Element | Purpose | Length |
|---------|---------|--------|
| **Problem** | Create urgency | 1-2 pages |
| **Solution** | Your proposal | 2-5 pages |
| **Benefit** | Why it matters | 1-2 pages |

### Example

**Problem:** Customer onboarding takes 45 days, causing 30% churn before activation and $2M annual revenue loss.

**Solution:** Implement automated onboarding: self-service configuration, automated migration, real-time tracking.

**Benefit:** Reduce onboarding to 14 days, cut churn by 80%, recover $1.6M annually.

## Law Review Article Structure

### Classic Five-Part

```
I.    INTRODUCTION
II.   BACKGROUND
III.  THE PROBLEM / ANALYSIS
IV.   THE SOLUTION / PROPOSAL
V.    CONCLUSION
```

### Section Guidance

| Section | % of Article | Purpose |
|---------|--------------|---------|
| Introduction | 5-10% | Hook, thesis, contribution, roadmap |
| Background | 15-25% | Context reader needs |
| Analysis | 30-40% | Your core contribution |
| Proposal | 20-30% | Concrete solutions |
| Conclusion | 2-5% | Summary, call to action |

### Introduction Elements

1. **Opening hook** — Concrete example, puzzle, or stakes
2. **Problem statement** — What issue this addresses
3. **Thesis** — One sentence stating your argument
4. **Contribution** — Why this matters; what's new
5. **Roadmap** — Preview of structure

---

## The One-Page Outline Method

Build structure before content.

1. **Write section headings only** — No content, just structure
2. **Arrange logically** — Does the document flow?
3. **Test the narrative** — Read headings in sequence
4. **Iterate** — Adjust until headings tell complete story
5. **Fill content** — Only now write body text

### The Readability Test

If someone reads only your headings and understands:
- What you're recommending
- Why they should agree
- What you want them to do

Then your outline works.

## Headings

### Action Headings vs. Topic Headings

| Topic (Weak) | Action (Strong) |
|--------------|-----------------|
| "Background" | "AI Systems Present Novel Liability Questions" |
| "Analysis" | "Current Doctrine Cannot Accommodate Agentic AI" |
| "Proposal" | "A Risk-Allocation Framework for Developer Contracts" |

Action headings are complete sentences that advance your argument.

---

## Framework Selection

| Scenario | Best Framework | Why |
|----------|---------------|-----|
| Board recommendation | SCQA + Pyramid | Clear decision structure |
| Complex analysis | Pyramid | Handles multiple arguments |
| Legal question | IRAC/CRAC | Standard legal reasoning |
| Proposal/pitch | Problem-Solution-Benefit | Drives action |
| Scholarly article | Five-part structure | Academic convention |

### Combining Frameworks

- **SCQA + Pyramid:** SCQA for overall arc, Pyramid for Answer section
- **Problem-Solution-Benefit within SCQA:** PSB becomes the Answer
- **One-Page Outline + Any:** Always outline first

## Quick Checklists

### Pyramid
- [ ] Main recommendation in first paragraph
- [ ] 3-5 supporting arguments, no more
- [ ] Each argument group is MECE
- [ ] Each argument has evidence
- [ ] No redundancy between sections

### SCQA
- [ ] Situation: context everyone agrees on
- [ ] Complication: tension that changed things
- [ ] Question: what decision must be made
- [ ] Answer: clear recommendation stated early

### Document Flow Test

Read only headings in sequence. Can someone understand:
1. What you're recommending?
2. Why they should agree?
3. What you want them to do?

### The "So What?" Test

After every section, ask: "So what?"

If you can't articulate why it matters to your argument:
1. Clarify the connection explicitly
2. Move to appendix
3. Delete it
