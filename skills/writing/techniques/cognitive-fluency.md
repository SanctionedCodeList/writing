# Cognitive Fluency

Research shows that ease of processing directly affects how readers judge truth, credibility, and quality. When text is easy to read, readers find it more persuasive—even when content is identical.

## Why Fluency Matters

The brain uses processing ease as a heuristic for truth. Easy-to-process claims feel more familiar, credible, and correct.

| Study | Finding |
|-------|---------|
| Oppenheimer (2006) | Complex vocabulary *reduces* perceived author intelligence |
| MIT (2023) | Even lawyers prefer plain English; recall improved 12%+ |
| Reber & Schwarz (1999) | High-contrast, easy-to-read text judged more true |
| Dechene et al. (meta-analysis) | Repeated statements seem truer (effect size: d = 0.39-0.50) |

**The Oppenheimer finding is key:** Using unnecessarily complex vocabulary doesn't signal intelligence—it signals the opposite. Simple words signal competence.

## Three Types of Fluency

### 1. Perceptual Fluency

How easily readers can *see* and decode the text.

**Affected by:**
- Font choice and contrast
- Line length (45-75 characters optimal, 66 ideal)
- White space and margins
- Visual hierarchy (headings, spacing)

### 2. Linguistic Fluency

How easily readers can *parse* the language.

**Affected by:**
- Sentence length (15-20 words average)
- Word frequency (common vs. rare)
- Active vs. passive voice
- Syntax complexity

### 3. Conceptual Fluency

How easily readers can *understand* the meaning.

**Affected by:**
- Logical flow (given-new contract)
- Connection to prior knowledge
- Concrete vs. abstract language
- Match with reader expectations

## Sentence-Level Techniques

### Optimal Sentence Length

| Length | Comprehension |
|--------|---------------|
| 8 words | ~100% |
| 14 words | ~90% |
| 20 words | Target average |
| 43+ words | Below 10% |

**Target 20 words on average.** Vary deliberately—some shorter for emphasis, some longer for complex relationships. If multiple consecutive sentences exceed 30 words, break at least one up.

### The Given-New Contract

Place known information before new information in each sentence.

The brain processes information by attaching new concepts to existing structures. When sentences start with familiar information and end with new, readers build understanding incrementally.

| Violates Given-New | Follows Given-New |
|--------------------|-------------------|
| "Novel approaches are needed. The EU AI Act represents one." | "The EU AI Act represents a novel approach. This approach differs from U.S. regulation in three ways." |
| "$2.5M in damages resulted. The breach occurred on March 15." | "The breach occurred on March 15. This breach caused $2.5M in damages." |

**Technique:** Start each sentence with a bridge to the previous sentence. End with your new point.

### Concrete Over Abstract

Concrete words activate both imagery and linguistic processing (Dual Coding Theory). Abstract words activate only linguistic processing.

| Abstract | Concrete |
|----------|----------|
| "The regulatory framework imposes obligations" | "The Colorado AI Act requires deployers to conduct impact assessments" |
| "Liability may attach in certain circumstances" | "Courts have held manufacturers liable when products malfunction" |
| "The doctrine addresses these concerns" | "*Palsgraf* limits liability to foreseeable plaintiffs" |

**Default to concrete language.** Ground abstract principles in specific cases, statutes, or examples.

### Sentence Variety

Monotonous patterns reduce engagement:
- Sentence rhythm variation improves retention by up to 25%
- Reader engagement increases 40% with diverse structures

**Pattern:** Long sentence developing a complex idea. Short punch. Another longer sentence building the argument. Impact.

## Paragraph-Level Techniques

### Topic Sentence Placement

Every paragraph should lead with its conclusion. The reader should never have to guess what the paragraph is about.

**Why:** Front-loading the point creates a framework; supporting sentences slot into place. Buried topic sentences force readers to hold details without knowing their purpose.

### Optimal Paragraph Length

| Context | Optimal Length |
|---------|----------------|
| General professional writing | 3-5 sentences (50-150 words) |
| Academic/complex analysis | 5-8 sentences (up to 200 words) |
| Maximum | 10-12 sentences if unified around one idea |

**Constraint:** One idea per paragraph. Multiple concepts = multiple paragraphs.

### Transitions

Use sparingly. The best transitions are structural—placing ideas in logical sequence so relationships are obvious without signaling words.

| Type | Examples | Use When |
|------|----------|----------|
| Addition | Also, And | Building on previous point |
| Contrast | However, But, Yet | Shifting direction |
| Causation | Therefore, So | Drawing conclusions |
| Example | For instance, Consider | Illustrating abstractions |

**Caution:** Overusing formal transitions (Moreover, Furthermore, Additionally) clutters prose and signals AI writing.

## Document-Level Techniques

### Structure as Navigation

Clear structure dramatically improves comprehension:
- Readers process structured documents faster
- Headings create "mental file folders"
- Predictable organization reduces cognitive load

### Informative Headings

| Generic (Weak) | Informative (Strong) |
|----------------|----------------------|
| "Background" | "AI Liability Under Current Doctrine" |
| "Analysis" | "Why Traditional Agency Law Fails for Autonomous Systems" |
| "Proposal" | "A Risk-Allocation Framework for Developer Contracts" |

**Test:** A reader skimming only headings should understand your argument's structure.

### Introduction as Framework

The introduction creates the mental framework readers use to process everything that follows.

**Required elements:**
1. **Hook** — Activate relevant prior knowledge
2. **Problem** — Create the gap your document fills
3. **Thesis** — Provide the organizing principle
4. **Roadmap** — Set structural expectations

## Active Voice

Studies prove the preference is not arbitrary:
- Active sentences are processed faster
- Comprehension and recall improve
- Passive constructions require mental reordering

| Passive | Active |
|---------|--------|
| "The order was vacated" | "The FTC vacated the order" |
| "It has been argued that" | "Scholars argue that" |
| "Mistakes were made" | "The agency made mistakes" |

**Target:** 80-85% active voice. Reserve passive for unknown actors, deliberate emphasis on objects, or strategic obscuring.

## Nominalization

Garner identifies nominalizations ("zombie nouns") as a bigger problem than passive voice.

Nominalizations convert actions (verbs) into things (nouns), draining energy and adding words:

| Nominalization | Verb Form | Words Saved |
|----------------|-----------|-------------|
| conduct an investigation | investigate | 2 |
| make a determination | determine | 2 |
| give consideration to | consider | 2 |
| reach a conclusion | conclude | 2 |

**The fix:** Search for "-tion," "-ment," "-ity" endings and convert back to verbs.

## The Illusory Truth Effect

A meta-analysis of 51 studies found repeated statements are judged more true (effect size: d = 0.39-0.50).

**Implications:**
1. **Use consistent terminology** — Don't vary terms for the same concept
2. **Repeat your thesis** — State in introduction, echo in section conclusions, restate at end
3. **Maintain consistent framing** — If you frame an issue one way, maintain that frame throughout

**Caution:** Repetition should reinforce, not pad. Say the same thing the same way.

## Fluency Targets Summary

| Element | Target |
|---------|--------|
| Average sentence length | 20 words |
| Paragraph length | 3-5 sentences (general), 5-8 (academic) |
| Active voice ratio | 80-85% |
| Topic sentence placement | First sentence |
| Information flow | Given → New |
| Line length | 45-75 characters |
| Terminology | Consistent throughout |

## The Speakability Test

Read your prose aloud. If you stumble, readers will too. Good writing is "speech pruned and polished."
