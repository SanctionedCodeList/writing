# Compelling Writing

Techniques from fiction, journalism, and cognitive science for engaging readers and strengthening persuasion.

## The Neuroscience of Engagement

The brain processes stories as simulated experience. Compelling narrative triggers dopamine release and heightened concentration—an evolutionary mechanism for learning from others' experiences.

**Implications:**
- Frame your case as a story the reader experiences, not a report they evaluate
- Create characters whose fates matter
- Build toward discoveries rather than front-loading everything

## Two Routes to Persuasion

The Elaboration Likelihood Model (Petty & Cacioppo) explains how persuasion works:

| Route | Processing | What Persuades | When Used |
|-------|-----------|----------------|-----------|
| **Central** | Careful, analytical | Argument quality, evidence | High motivation + ability |
| **Peripheral** | Superficial, heuristic | Credibility, format, ease | Low motivation or ability |

**Strategy:** Design for central processing (strong arguments) while ensuring peripheral cues don't undermine you (credibility, format, fluency).

## Narrative Drive

Two psychological forces create forward momentum:

**Curiosity**: "What happens next?" Create through:
- A central dramatic question
- Section endings that foreshadow rather than resolve
- Strategic withholding

**Concern**: "What will happen to this person?" Create through:
- Using names to humanize
- Showing agency and choices
- Making stakes concrete

## The Dramatic Question

Every compelling narrative centers on one overarching question.

**In legal writing:** "Can an employer terminate for conduct the employer authorized?" "Does the Constitution permit warrantless surveillance of phones?"

This question should appear in your introduction and echo through every section.

## Hooks

You have seconds to capture attention. First sentences matter disproportionately.

| Type | Example | Use For |
|------|---------|---------|
| **Question** | "What happens when an agency claims authority Congress never granted?" | Issue framing |
| **Statement** | "The government's position would criminalize ordinary business decisions." | Stakes elevation |
| **Scene** | "On March 15, 2024, federal agents arrived at 5 a.m." | Factual narratives |
| **Statistic** | "Ninety-two percent of patent cases settle. This one didn't." | Context setting |

**Avoid:** Throat-clearing ("This case involves..."), procedural recitation as opening, abstract concepts before stakes.

## Tension

Tension keeps readers engaged. When missing, documents feel inconsequential.

**Sources of tension:**
- **Uncertainty**: Signal the case could go either way
- **Stakes escalation**: Raise consequences as the document progresses
- **Value collision**: Frame disputes as conflicts between legitimate interests
- **Time pressure**: Emphasize deadlines or irreversibility

## Structure Options

| Structure | Method | Best For |
|-----------|--------|----------|
| **Front-loaded** | Conclusion in first paragraph | Clear legal wins, busy readers |
| **Narrative build** | Facts → Discovery → Conclusion | Sympathetic facts, complex stories |
| **WSJ approach** | Specific case → Broader principle → Return to case | Policy arguments, amicus briefs |

## Character

Make your client human:
- Use names, not procedural labels ("Ms. Chen," not "Plaintiff")
- Show agency: what did they do, decide, attempt?
- Acknowledge complexity: perfect victims don't exist

For adversaries:
- Avoid cartoonish villainy—it damages credibility
- Let actions speak through facts, not adjectives
- Keep descriptions concrete and documented

## Handling Weaknesses: The Defang Technique

Never ignore weaknesses. Acknowledge and pivot:

- **Placement**: Bury unfavorable facts mid-paragraph, between favorable facts
- **Proportion**: Spend less time; don't repeat unfavorable facts
- **Context**: Provide context that reduces damage
- **Transition**: Use acknowledgment as springboard to your strongest point

## Pacing

Vary sentence length for rhythm:

**For urgency:**
> The statute is clear. It requires notice. The agency provided none.

**For complexity:**
> While the agency contends informal communication satisfied the requirement, the text, history, and regulations all point to a more formal process—one undisputedly not followed.

**General:** Average 18-22 words, but vary deliberately.

## Cognitive Triggers

| Trigger | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| **Authority** | Lead with binding precedent; cite respected treatises |
| **Social proof** | Note how other courts ruled; cite industry standards |
| **Consistency** | Frame as extension of established principles |
| **Reciprocity** | Acknowledge valid opposing points before pivoting |
| **Scarcity** | Emphasize irreversible harm, unique circumstances |

## The Story Sandwich

Structure for maximum persuasion:

1. **Open with story** (pathos) — Hook with human stakes
2. **Anchor in authority** (ethos) — Establish legal framework
3. **Build logical structure** (logos) — Analysis
4. **Return to stakes** (pathos) — Close with what's at stake

## Narrative Transportation

"Narrative transportation" (Green & Brock, 2000) describes immersive reading. When transported, readers:
- Experience reduced counterarguing
- Show more story-consistent beliefs
- Feel emotional responses to characters

A well-crafted statement of facts can transport the reader, reducing resistance to your conclusions.

## Decision Fatigue

Judges make numerous decisions daily. Each depletes cognitive resources.

**The famous study:** Favorable parole rulings at ~65% after breaks, dropping to near 0% before breaks—regardless of case merit.

**Implications:**
- Reduce cognitive load through clear structure
- Front-load strongest arguments
- Make the favorable ruling the cognitively easy choice
- Use visual organization to reduce processing effort

## Understatement Over Overstatement

Empirical research confirms: briefs with minimal emotional language win significantly more often.

| Avoid | Prefer |
|-------|--------|
| "egregious," "outrageous," "shocking" | Let facts demonstrate severity |
| "clearly," "obviously," "plainly" | State propositions with confidence |
| "frivolous," "absurd," "ridiculous" | Explain why the argument fails |

**Why emotional language backfires:**
- Signals lack of substantive arguments
- Triggers skepticism in trained readers
- Undermines credibility

## The Read-Aloud Test

Read your work aloud. Your ear will detect:
- Awkward phrasing
- Sentences that run too long
- Loss of natural voice
- Pace problems
- Repetition

If you stumble reading it, readers will stumble too.
