## The One-Minute Scan

Before declaring done, verify:

1. **First sentence of document**: Does it state your point?
2. **First sentence of each section**: Does it advance the argument?
3. **Last paragraph**: Does it deliver impact or trail off?
4. **Headings alone**: Do they tell the story?
5. **Read one random paragraph aloud**: Any stumbles?
